<h1>THE TRIUMPH OF VIRGINIA DALE</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>HER MISSION IN LIFE</span></h2>

<p>Obadiah Dale was the richest man in South Ridgefield.
He owned the great textile mill down by the
river where hundreds of people were employed and
which hummed and clattered from morning until night
to add to his wealth. He lived in a fine house. About
it, broad lawns, shaded by ancient elms and dotted
with groups of shrubbery, formed a verdant setting
for the walls and massive porch pillars spotless in
white paint.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s only child was Virginia. She was a
charming bit of girlhood with a complexion so clear
that it seemed pale in contrast to the black hair and
the clearly lined brows which arched those big, serious,
blue eyes.</p>

<p>On an afternoon in early June she was reading on
the couch which swung from the lofty ceiling of the
porch when she became aware that some one was coming
up the walk from the gate. She arose and her
face lighted with happiness as she ran down the steps
to greet a smartly dressed woman of middle age.
&#8220;Oh, Hennie dear,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I am so glad that
you&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>The older woman laughed gaily as she caught the
girl in her arms, &#8220;You know I couldn&#8217;t forget your
birthday, Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you wouldn&#8217;t do that, Hennie. You don&#8217;t
come often,&#8221; the girl sighed, &#8220;but you always remember
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson kissed her little hostess. Always
had her big heart gone out to this motherless maid.
Long ago she had been the intimate friend of Virginia&#8217;s
mother. Elinor Dale had died when her daughter
was a year old so that Hennie had a twofold reason
for loving her young friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to have you here,&#8221; exclaimed the girl
as she drew her visitor to a chair by the couch. &#8220;I
wish you would come every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, listen to that. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better, please,
for you to come and see me instead of planning for
a poor old woman,&#8221;&#8211;Mrs. Henderson did not look
the part&#8211;&#8220;who has twinges of rheumatism, to make
daily calls upon you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia regarded her guest with great seriousness.
&#8220;I come to your house very often, Hennie. I was
over the other day, but,&#8221;&#8211;she gave another sigh,&#8211;&#8220;you
were not home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do remember. Carrie told me that you were
over with Serena. I supposed that you came to see
her. I am on so many committees for various charitable
organizations<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; She stopped short and reaching
over patted the girl&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I am sorry that
I was not home, dear. I should remember that you
are rather old to call upon my negro cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s eyes danced. &#8220;I must have called upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
Carrie a thousand times since I was a baby. A few
more calls in your kitchen instead of your parlor won&#8217;t
hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you laughing?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you a secret about your own house but
you must agree not to use it against Carrie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Hennie, you might be interested to know
that refreshments are served oftener in your kitchen
than your parlor. I learned that years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very idea!&#8221; exclaimed the caller.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s gaze wandered thoughtfully over the beautiful
grounds. &#8220;I do so love to have you here. I
don&#8217;t see very many people.&#8221; Her voice was wistful.
&#8220;This big place gets lonesome sometimes. I think
I envy girls who live in houses with stoops on the
sidewalk. They have the cars, peddlers, policemen
and lots of people going by all of the time. It would
be great fun to live that way.&#8221; She was very sober
now. &#8220;I think that I want noises and lots of things
going on. Am I very strange, Hennie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No indeed, all young people are that way,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Henderson with emphasis. &#8220;I felt so myself,
once. Of course, it is lonely for you in this big house
with only Serena. Your father is home for so short a
time each day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I am not very
lonely&#8211;only a little bit. If something interesting&#8211;something
exciting and wildly adventurous&#8211;would
happen, Hennie, it would be fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson smiled. &#8220;I am afraid that I can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
help you in such ways, dear, but I have something here
which I am very sure that you will dearly love.&#8221; She
drew forth a small parcel from her bag.</p>

<p>Virginia waited in pleased expectation. &#8220;I am going
to adore it,&#8221; she cried joyously, as, accepting the
package, she prolonged anticipation by inspecting it
curiously, &#8220;because you gave it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will care for it for other reasons,&#8221; replied
the older woman soberly.</p>

<p>Within the wrappings, the girl found a little volume,
the cover of which was much worn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be misled by appearances,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
suggested as Virginia opened the book.</p>

<p>Upon the fly leaf, written in ink faded with age, was
the name, Elinor Clark. The girl&#8217;s eyes opened wide
in wonder and suppressed delight. &#8220;It was my
mother&#8217;s book, Hennie?&#8221; she asked gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, it was a girlhood possession of your
mother. During her last illness she gave it to me and
asked me to see that you got it on your eighteenth
birthday. She explained that she didn&#8217;t want to
trouble your father, yet she wanted you to have it.
It was the last request Elinor ever made of me.&#8221; Mrs.
Henderson&#8217;s eyes winked suspiciously and leaning forward
she peered at the worn cover. When she spoke
her voice was husky with emotion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a gift that
you will always cherish, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great tenderness swept over Virginia&#8217;s face.
&#8220;It&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s birthday present to me, isn&#8217;t it, Hennie?&#8221;&#8211;she
almost whispered&#8211;&#8220;the only one that
I can remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the older woman bowed her agreement, she moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
over upon the couch by the girl and for a time they
were silent.</p>

<p>Virginia was the first to speak. &#8220;Tell me about
my mother, please,&#8221; she said softly, her hand caressing
the cover of the book. &#8220;It makes Daddy sad if
I talk to him too much about her so I never do.
But Hennie, I should like to know more of her if I
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, I will gladly tell you everything
I can, dear.&#8221; She was thoughtful for a moment and
then resumed, &#8220;Your mother was three years older
than you are now when I first met her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And married,&#8221; cried the girl in surprise, &#8220;I never
thought of my mother as so young. I pictured her as
much older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old, nonsense! Your mother was my age. She
was hardly grown at the time of her death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did my father meet her? I know that she
lived down South. Serena is always talking about the
old home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He met her here in South Ridgefield. He had come
here from New England and started his mill. It was
small in those days, but prosperous. Social affairs had
little attraction for your father. That made him very
interesting to us girls. I suppose too we did not forget
that he was making lots of money and could give
the girl of his choice everything she desired. He had
been here four or five years when the marriage took
place. Its announcement caused much excitement
among us young people. We had given your father
up as a hopeless old bachelor. Think of it, in a week,
your mother snatched the best catch from under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
noses of the South Ridgefield girls.&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
laughed gaily. &#8220;Elinor did that very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother must have been very beautiful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was, every one admitted that, but she had the
advantage in another way. She came from Virginia
after her father&#8217;s death to settle some business affairs
with your father.&#8221; Again Mrs. Henderson laughed.
&#8220;The girls used to say that he took Elinor in full settlement
of all indebtedness. After the marriage he
built this house and you were born,&#8221; she pointed upwards,
&#8220;in that big corner room on the second floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go on, Hennie,&#8221; begged the girl, after a
pause in which the older woman&#8217;s thoughts wandered
in the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the good times I&#8217;ve had in this
house. Your mother used to give delightful dances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dances, <i>here</i>!&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s astonishment was evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I have danced here many times until
three o&#8217;clock in the morning and thought nothing of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You danced, too?&#8221; It was as if the girl were
shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I danced. Do you think I was a wall
flower who could lure no partners to myself?&#8221; Mrs.
Henderson demanded with spirit. &#8220;Remember, I
had been married only a year. There were grand dinners,
too.&#8221; She went on more calmly. &#8220;How we enjoyed
Serena&#8217;s cooking and afterwards many is the
gay crowd this porch sheltered in those days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard to imagine, Hennie.&#8221; The girl shook
her head soberly. &#8220;Daddy and I are so quiet. We sit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
here in the evenings and I talk until he falls asleep.
Then I watch the fire-flies until he wakes up and we
go to bed. The thought of him dancing is very
strange.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a note of pity in Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s voice
when she spoke, &#8220;To be sure it is, dear. I never said
that your father danced. He seemed to enjoy having
people here. It was your mother, though, who loved
that sort of thing and her word was law to him in
everything. She depended on Hezekiah Wilkins to set
the pace by wielding a rhythmic toe, as he used to call
it.&#8221; A smile of gay memories died in her eyes at more
solemn thoughts. &#8220;Those good times lasted only a
couple of years. Your mother was taken ill and
then&#8211;&#8221; she paused and continued softly, &#8220;&#8211;one afternoon
she went away from the room upstairs and
left you, dear,&#8221; her voice caught, &#8220;to Serena and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s arm went about the girl but in a
moment she resumed, &#8220;After the death of your mother
your father devoted himself to money making again.
It took all of his time.&#8221; There was a flash of anger in
her eye. &#8220;He has succeeded very well in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson arose hastily. &#8220;Dear me, child, I
am staying too long. You should go to some of these
youthful affairs about town. I imagine that the boys
and girls of South Ridgefield have some very good
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes lighted with interest but in a moment
it had gone, replaced by a thoughtful little smile.
&#8220;Daddy would be lonely without me. I ought not to
leave him alone in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the angry glint came in Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
eyes, but she controlled herself and said quietly, &#8220;You
are the best judge of that, dear. But now that you
have finished school you should have something to occupy
your time. I know that Serena would have you
play great lady, but, with due respect to her ideas, you
will find it a lonely game in these busy days. Why
don&#8217;t you give some of your time to helping those not
so fortunate as you? Think it over, child,&#8221; she urged
as she left.</p>

<p>After her caller had departed Virginia returned to
the couch and with intense interest gave herself up
to the examination of the book which had been her
mother&#8217;s.</p>

<p>A negress of uncertain age appeared in the doorway
of the house. Her hair was streaked with grey and
she was enormously fat. She wore a calico dress over
the front of which stretched a snowy white apron, its
strings lost in a crease of flesh at the waist line.
Bound about her head was a white handkerchief and
her sleeves were rolled to her elbows.</p>

<p>She moved about the porch replacing the wicker furniture.
Stopping by the couch she rearranged some
magazines, and then, &#8220;Honey chil&#8217;, ain&#8217; you gwine
git dressed? De clock done struck fo&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Serena&#8217;s eyes wandered to the side lawn. Instantly
her attention was riveted upon certain objects protruding
from some shrubbery. They were conspicuous and
unusual as lawn decorations, bulking large beside a recumbent
lawn mower, a rake and grass shears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Ike,&#8221; she shouted. The objects moved convulsively.
&#8220;Wot you mean a sleepin&#8217; under dat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
bush?&#8221; The commotion in the shrubbery ceased and
the objects reappeared in their normal position as the
feet of a sleepy-eyed negro youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217; a sleepin&#8217; none, Miss Sereny, ah was a
layin&#8217; under dat bush a ca&#8217;culatin&#8217; whar ah gwine to
trim it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got a po&#8217; haid fo&#8217; figgers den. You computen
all dis yere afternoon, ah guesses. Ma eye is on you,
boy. Go change you&#8217; clothes an&#8217; git dat ca&#8217;ah down to
de office a fo&#8217; you is late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike gathered the tools and disappeared in haste.</p>

<p>Serena turned again to the girl, who had displayed
but slight interest in the sleeping laborer. &#8220;It gittin&#8217;
mighty late, chil&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, Serena.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bettah dress you&#8217;se&#8217;f.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, only a little longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gwine be fo&#8217;ced to be mighty spry den,&#8221;
warned the old negress as she waddled into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how wonderful,&#8221; breathed the girl, a great joy
suddenly showing in her face. &#8220;It&#8217;s for me&#8211;from
mother. Really.&#8221;</p>

<p>The worn volume lay open in her lap. It contained
selections from the works of many poets. Upon the
page before her these lines, taken from Coleridge&#8217;s,
&#8220;The Ancient Mariner,&#8221; were printed,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;He prayeth best who loveth best</p>
<p>All things both great and small:</p>
<p>For the dear God who loveth us,</p>
<p>He made and loveth all.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>They were heavily underlined. In the broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
margin was written in a tremulous hand which displayed
the effects of illness,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;My darling little daughter&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8211;live these lines. <span class='sc'>Elinor Dale.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>A vast tenderness enfolded the girl. She reread the
lines. &#8220;My mother is telling me how to live,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;Her voice is calling to me through all
the years&#8211;the only time.&#8221; She touched her lips impulsively
to the place where the cherished hand had
rested and then, clasping the book to her breast, she
closed her eyes and remained so for awhile. When her
lids raised anew, the blue eyes were filled with a great
yearning as she breathed softly and reverently as if in
prayer, &#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later, Virginia entered the house and Serena
told her, &#8220;Ah done lay out yo&#8217;all&#8217;s clothes, honey chil&#8217;.
Ef you want anythin&#8217; else jes yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl dreamily climbed the broad staircase. At
the bend she remembered something, and, turning back,
smiled down at the old colored woman below. &#8220;Thank
you, Serena,&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>Amply rewarded, the faithful servant contentedly
busied herself once more with the affairs of the Dale
household. From that far away day when she had,
&#8220;&#8217;cided ah gwine foller Miss Elinor to de no&#8217;th,&#8221; she
had been recognized by well informed persons as one in
authority in that home.</p>

<p>It was Serena who first held Virginia in her arms
and tenderly rocked the squirming red mite across her
ample bosom. During those long days and nights of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
watching in the last illness of Elinor Dale, it was Serena
who, with undisguised distrust of the trained nurse,
was in and out of the sick room almost every hour. It
was Serena who closed Elinor Dale&#8217;s eyes, and it was
Serena who held the motherless child with great tears
rolling down her black face as she stood by the open
grave.</p>

<p>No formal agreement held Serena after the death of
her mistress. She saw the home as a storm tossed
craft, from whose deck the navigator had been swept,
drifting aimlessly upon the sea of domesticity. Unhesitatingly,
she had assumed the vacant command
which carried with it the mothering of Virginia.</p>

<p>In the early months of his bereavement, Obadiah
Dale gave some attention to the establishment which
he had created for his wife&#8217;s enjoyment. Yet all
things followed a well managed routine and, more important
than all to a man of his nature, the monthly
bills evidenced economical judgment. Quick to recognize
a valuable subordinate, Obadiah saw no necessity
for immediate change.</p>

<p>Serena had excellent ideas in child training. Although
in her mind Virginia was a young lady of position
who could properly demand appropriate attention,
yet must she learn to meet the responsibilities of her
station.</p>

<p>Obadiah was assured that his daughter in Serena&#8217;s
charge was in the care of one who loved her. From
time to time he made vague plans for the child&#8217;s future.
As they were to commence at an indefinite time
they never materialized. More and more the business
activities of the manufacturer occupied his time, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
slowly but surely the duty of Virginia&#8217;s upbringing
was shifted to the negro woman.</p>

<p>When Virginia was five, Serena told her employer,
&#8220;Dis yere chil&#8217; orter be in school a learnin&#8217; mo&#8217; an&#8217;
ah kin teach her,&#8221; and so the mill owner&#8217;s daughter
was started upon her scholastic career at a kindergarten.</p>

<p>Obadiah never knew the worries of this illiterate
negro woman in planning suitable clothing for his
child. No man could appreciate that watchful eye
ever ready to copy styles and materials from the garments
of children of families deemed worthy as models.</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s education was continued under the guidance
of a Miss Keen who conducted a select school for
young ladies in South Ridgefield. This institution,
highly esteemed as a seat of learning by Serena, offered
courses usually terminating when pupils refused
longer to attend the establishment. In its most prosperous
years its enrollment never exceeded twenty misguided
maidens.</p>

<p>Now, Virginia had arrived at the age of eighteen,
a serious, rather shy girl, whose youth had been spent
under the supervision of an old negro woman, narrowed
by the influence of a small school and neglected
by a busy father.</p>

<p>When Obadiah came home that night for dinner,
she met him in the hall. He was a very tall man and
extremely thin. His sharp features gave a shrewd expression
and his smooth shaven face displayed a cruel
mouth and an obstinate jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Daddy dear,&#8221; cried the girl as she held up
her mouth to be kissed. She gave a happy little laugh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
when he pinched her cheek, and demanded of him,
&#8220;What day is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuesday,&#8221; he answered indifferently, &#8220;the tenth
of June.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a holiday, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s my birthday, Daddy dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He displayed some interest now. &#8220;Is that so?
How old are you today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am eighteen,&#8221; she explained proudly. &#8220;Serena
made me a cake with candles. She brought it in at
lunch. She said it might bother you, tonight.&#8221;
She looked up at him quickly. &#8220;Do you love me,
Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he answered absently and shaking his
iron grey head he ascended the stairs to prepare for
dinner, muttering, &#8220;Time flies&#8211;how time flies.&#8221;</p>

<p>He joined his daughter again in the dining room in
response to the gong. Serena had planned the meal
with due regard to the fact that the day had been
warm. A lobster, magnificent in its gorgeousness,
reposed upon a bed of lettuce on the platter before
Obadiah. A potato salad flanked it and a dish of
sliced tomatoes reflected the color scheme of the crustacean.
Dainty rolls, Serena&#8217;s pride, peeped from the
folds of a napkin and the ice clinked refreshingly in
the tall tumblers of tea as they were stirred.</p>

<p>Sometimes Virginia and her father chatted, but there
were long silences. At intervals, Serena, noiselessly in
spite of her weight, appeared to replenish or change a
dish and to see that all things were in order.</p>

<p>As they waited for the table to be cleared for dessert,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
the girl said wistfully, &#8220;I wish that I could help somebody,
Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously. &#8220;What ever put that
into your head? You are a help to me sitting there
and smiling at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but that&#8217;s not much. To sit at a table and
smile and eat good things only helps oneself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why should you want to help anybody but you
and me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed at him thoughtfully. &#8220;Don&#8217;t joke,
Daddy. I know I would be happier if I could do something
for some one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah chuckled. &#8220;Where did you get that idea?
I am perfectly happy tonight, and I haven&#8217;t bothered
myself about other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very idea. All this livelong day you have
been planning for those who work in your mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden light came to him, he chuckled again.
&#8220;Surely, I look after my employees or they would
look after me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes you happy.&#8221; Virginia was certain that
she had made her point.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Obadiah shook his head vigorously, &#8220;my
employees make me angry more than they make me
happy. My happiness is the result of my own efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I mean, Daddy. You have had such
great opportunities to make yourself happy.&#8221; She
viewed him with eyes of fond admiration. &#8220;You have
accomplished so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah was filled with a comfortable egotism. &#8220;I
have accomplished a whole lot,&#8221; he boasted. His mind
was upon his commercial success and the wealth he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
had accumulated. &#8220;I&#8217;m not through,&#8221; he bragged.
He became thoughtful as he dwelt upon certain fertile
fields awaiting his financial plough. His jaw set.
He had rivals who would contest his tillage. He
would fight as he had always fought. His eyes glistened
beneath his shaggy brows as he sensed the fray.</p>

<p>The conversation languished as they ate their dessert,
but Obadiah&#8217;s pride of accomplishment had not departed.
&#8220;I am going to do bigger things than ever
before,&#8221; he exulted. &#8220;When you are older you will
realize what I have done for you,&#8221; he explained as
they went out on the porch.</p>

<p>For a time the girl and the old man followed their
own thoughts while the fire-flies sparkled and gleamed
about the lawn as if they were the flashlights of a
fairy patrol. Emma Virginia was thinking of her
father&#8217;s words. He was going to do more for her.
She must certainly share her blessings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy dear, do you mind if I help some one?&#8221; she
asked gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back on that?&#8221; he demanded with a note of sharpness.</p>

<p>She gave an emphatic little nod. &#8220;It is very important.
I&#8211;I&#8211;can&#8217;t tell you now, why,&#8221; she hesitated.
&#8220;I should feel much better, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not sick, are you?&#8221; Obadiah worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no indeed, perfectly well. Only, I am sure
that I would be much happier if I could do something
for someone else. I don&#8217;t know whom. That doesn&#8217;t
make any difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a strange idea!&#8221; It seemed to bother
Obadiah. &#8220;You want to help someone but you don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
know whom.&#8221; He considered a moment. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
my advice. Help somebody who can help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you are teasing me, Daddy?&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;I am really serious about this. I want to be of more
use in the world.&#8221; Her voice was very soft and gentle
now. &#8220;I know that I should share my blessings and
I want to do it. It is such a comfort to talk things
over with you, Daddy dearest.&#8221; She moved quietly
over to him and seated herself upon his lap.</p>

<p>As she touched him, he jumped. &#8220;Gracious, you
startled me so, Virginia. I was asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Daddy, don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be quiet as a mouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost grudgingly, he let her settle herself and
drop her head against his shoulder. In a moment his
head slipped down against the soft hair of the girl and
Obadiah dozed anew.</p>

<p>She murmured softly, &#8220;It was so easy to explain to
you. Serena wouldn&#8217;t understand, I am afraid. All of
your life, Daddy, you have been helping other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom?&#8221; asked Obadiah in alarm, starting up
and shaking the girl&#8217;s head from his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy, wake up. You were asleep while I was
talking to you.&#8221; She tried to kiss him as he rubbed
his eyes, but his arms were in her way. &#8220;You are such
a comfort, Daddy. I wish I could be like you,&#8221; she
said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can try,&#8221; conceded Obadiah immodestly.
&#8220;You are keeping me up. I am tired. I want to go
to bed. My legs are asleep from your sitting on them,&#8221;
he complained and then told her shortly, &#8220;The place
for you to dream is in bed, not on my lap.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MISSION BEGUN</span></h2>

<p>Obadiah Dale&#8217;s car was waiting at his home. It
stood upon the gravel driveway opposite the steps at
the end of the porch. Virginia was seated in the rear
seat and her eyes rested seriously upon Serena, who
from the higher floor of the porch, viewed Ike, lounging
by the car, as from a rostrum.</p>

<p>The young negro was attired in a neat livery which
gave him a natty aspect distinctly absent when his
siesta was disturbed by Serena. Regardless of his
more attractive guise, however, he shifted nervously
under her stern gaze. He, who ever bore himself, in
hours of leisure, before the black population of South
Ridgefield as one of imperial blood, was abashed before
her. That poise, that coolness of demeanor, that almost
insolent manner exhibited at crap games, chicken
fights or those social functions where the gentler sex
predominates, was absent now. Before Serena, his
lofty soul became as a worm, desirous of burying itself
from the pitiless light of publicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Ike,&#8221; she said with great severity, &#8220;mine
wot ah say. Stop you&#8217; fas&#8217; drivin&#8217;. Miss Virginy
ain&#8217; wantin&#8217; to go shootin&#8217; aroun&#8217; dis yere town lak
er circus lady in er cha&#8217;iot race.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>The girl displayed interest in the remark, but remained
silent.</p>

<p>Ike climbed into the car and sought support from
the steering wheel. In a gentle manner, as if desirous
of averting wrath, he made answer, &#8220;Ah ain&#8217;
no speeder, Miss Sereny. Ah is de carefulest chauffah
in dis town. Ah sez, &#8216;Safety fust.&#8217; Dat&#8217;s ma
motta.&#8221; At the sound of his own voice he gained in
assurance. He had acquired these statements by heart
from frequent repetition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wat you down in dat co&#8217;t fo&#8217;, den?&#8221; inquired Serena.
&#8220;Mr. Dale he done say, he gittin&#8217; tired er payin&#8217;
fines fo&#8217; yo&#8217;all. He say de nex&#8217; time he gwine ax de
jedge to let you rot in dat calaboose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike listened to this promise of extended incarceration
with the casual interest due an oft repeated tale.
Disregarding it, he continued, &#8220;Ah goes to co&#8217;t &#8217;count
o&#8217; de inexpe&#8217;ienced drivers.&#8221; He spoke as an expert.
&#8220;Ef dey had &#8217;spe&#8217;ienced drivers dey ain&#8217; gwine be
no trouble a tall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey bettah be no mo&#8217; trouble,&#8221; snapped Serena,
&#8220;les yo&#8217;all gits in worse. G&#8217;wan now &#8217;bout you&#8217; business.
Take Miss Virginy down to de sto&#8217; an&#8217; den out
on de river road. You gotta git back in time
to bring her pa home fo&#8217; lunch.&#8221; The solution of a
difficult problem dawned upon her and instantly she
returned to her former argument. &#8220;Don&#8217; you drive
dat caah no fas&#8217;er den er hoss an&#8217; er ker&#8217;idge kin go,&#8221;
she commanded.</p>

<p>It is of record that even a worm upon extreme irritation
will fall upon its tormentor. Thus Ike reacted
to this notable example of feminine ignorance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
&#8220;How&#8217;s ah gwine mek dis yere high powah caah run
dat slow? Ah ast you dat? How&#8217;s ah gwine do
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently heedless of this incipient rebellion, Serena
gave her attention to her young mistress, &#8220;Good
bye, honey chil&#8217;,&#8221; she worried. &#8220;Don&#8217; you mek
youse&#8217;f sick on sody an&#8217; ice cream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia smiled sweetly at the now beaming black
face of the negro woman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be very careful,&#8221;
she promised.</p>

<p>Serena devoted herself again to her minion. &#8220;You
Ike, go slow. Go mighty cafful. Dat&#8217;s wot ah say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked askance at her. Every vestige of humor
had departed from the black face replaced by a cold,
implacable glare. Without a word, he started the
machine and it glided down the drive.</p>

<p>Her purchases completed, Virginia sat musing upon
the message from her mother as the big car hummed
softly towards the quiet beauty of the river road.
Vague plans, indefinite as dreams, floated through her
mind.</p>

<p>Ike was obeying Serena&#8217;s wishes so faithfully that
the absence of excitement, so essential to the display
of what he considered his best talents, was almost lulling
him to sleep.</p>

<p>A large bill board fenced the front of a vacant lot,
on their way. A magnificent example of the lithographer&#8217;s
art, as adapted to the advertising needs of a
minstrel show, was posted upon it. It&#8217;s coloring,
chiefly red, was effective and forceful and displayed an
extravagant disregard of the high cost of ink. It portrayed
the triumphant passage of the Jubilee Minstrels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
The brilliant uniforms, the martial air of the musicians
as well as the exceeding pleasure with which this
aggregation appeared to be welcomed by the reviewing
public, was of a character to please, to impress, yes,
even to stun all beholders, except the blind.</p>

<p>This picture caught the soul of Ike as he came within
the scope of its influence. To him, applause and admiration
were as strong drink. Envy knocked at his
heart as he beheld the bright raiment. He visualized
himself, thus dazzlingly attired, exhibited to his admiring
fellow townsmen. Violating speed laws was infantile
piffle to this. A syncopated melody, appropriate
to a victorious march, blared in memory&#8217;s ear.
He hummed it softly. His body twitched to the
rhythm and his feet took up the cadence. He pressed
a pedal and the powerful car accelerated its motion
well above the modest limits commanded by Serena.
To the shell of Ike, the increased speed was but a return
to normal. His spirit was away. Expanding
as a morning-glory to the sun, it paraded, in wondrous
garments, to martial music, before gaping thousands.</p>

<p>A turn in their way was before them. Ike partially
roused himself from his sweet dreams and automatically
attended to the necessities of the moment.
These included no slackening of speed.</p>

<p>The car swung a corner and instantly thereafter
there came a mighty groaning of brakes as it was
finally stopped in the midst of what had been an orderly
procession of small negro children. The startling
arrival of the big machine had scattered them,
with shrill cries and screams, in every direction.</p>

<p>Virginia was alarmed at the sudden halt and at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
frightened outcries of the youngsters. She leaped
out. On the curb an excited colored woman was holding
a weeping black boy by the hand. He was very
small and, because of a deformed leg, used a crutch.
Between efforts to reassemble her scattered charges,
she endeavored to calm and comfort him.</p>

<p>Hurrying to the woman, Virginia cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m so
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much good sorry gwine do after you kill somebody,&#8221;
shouted the woman, much angered by the occurrence.
&#8220;Ain&#8217; you got no bettah sense &#8217;en to run
down a lot o&#8217; chillun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been terrible if we had hurt one
of them. I never would have forgiven myself. We
couldn&#8217;t see them until we turned the corner.&#8221; In
her excitement she sought friendly support. &#8220;Could
we, Ike?&#8221;</p>

<p>To Ike, it was a duty from which much pleasure
could be derived to take part in any controversy.
Likewise, one acquires merit, when one is a chauffeur,
by strongly maintaining the contention of one&#8217;s mistress&#8211;she
may reciprocate in a difficult hour. Ike
turned an unfriendly countenance upon the woman,
and asked for information, &#8220;How ah gwine see &#8217;roun&#8217;
er corner? Does you &#8217;spect dat ma eyes is twisted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go long, man. Mine you&#8217; own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not thus summarily was Ike to be dismissed.
&#8220;Dese yere chillun ain&#8217; no call to be in de street.
Howcum &#8217;em der? Ain&#8217; it yo&#8217;all&#8217;s business to keep &#8217;em
outen de way?&#8221; A uniformity in costume struck him.
&#8220;Ain&#8217; dey orphant chillun runnin&#8217; loose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orphans! The poor things!&#8221; Virginia cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>&#8220;Wot ef dey is orphants?&#8221; the woman protested
with great belligerence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Den,&#8221; Ike behaved as if he, a public spirited citizen,
had discovered the warden of a penitentiary seeking
pleasure beyond the walls with notorious criminals,
&#8220;howcum dey heah? Wharfo?&#8221;</p>

<p>The suspicion and force in the chauffeur&#8217;s manner
brought fresh tears to orphan eyes.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these evidences of public attention,
Ike continued his investigation. &#8220;Ah axes you woman,
why ain&#8217; dey in de &#8217;sylum whar dey &#8217;long?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chauffeur&#8217;s words had not soothed the guardian
of the children. She showed unmistakable signs
of increasing wrath. Glaring fixedly at him, she
blazed, &#8220;Mine you&#8217; own business, you black po&#8217;cupine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the application of the epithet was obscure,
its effect was all that could be desired. Ike suffered a
species of fit. His mouth opened and closed without
sound. His wildly rolling eyes exposed wide areas
of white and then glued themselves in invenomed hatred
upon the woman. Muscles contracted and worked
in his neck. Even as a panther, he appeared about to
spring upon his foe.</p>

<p>Virginia interfered. Her experience of life was
limited, but she understood the negro. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get
out of the car, Ike,&#8221; she ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef dat spindle legged dude git outen dat caah, ah
is boun&#8217; to bus&#8217; his haid wid ma fist,&#8221; predicted the
woman.</p>

<p>Virginia feared no blood shed but deemed it
desirable to take steps to avoid an argument certain to
be loud and long and to add nothing to her dignity as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
a bystander. She answered Ike&#8217;s inquiries herself.
&#8220;The children were out walking, I suppose, and had
to cross the street?&#8221;</p>

<p>This overture slightly mollified the woman but she
yet viewed the porcupine with distinct hostility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are all of these poor children orphans?&#8221; continued
Virginia, shaking her head at the pity of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m, dey&#8217;s all orphants f&#8217;om the Lincoln Home,
up de street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you had them out for their daily walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mam, dey gits out onest er week. Ah ain&#8217;
got no time to take &#8217;em out every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia looked at the woman very thoughtfully.
&#8220;Your work makes you very happy, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217; heard o&#8217; no kind er wo&#8217;k mekin&#8217; nobody
happy. Ah jes allers was, an&#8217; allers is happy. Dat&#8217;s
me,&#8221; the woman explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you are a mother to all of those children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m, de onlies&#8217; mother dey gwine git, ah guesses.&#8221;
The woman viewed her reassembled charges speculatively.
She patted the little cripple at her side. &#8220;Po&#8217;
li&#8217;l Willie, he cain&#8217;t walk ve&#8217;y fas&#8217;, kin you, sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor little fellow,&#8221; sighed Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah bettah tote you, Willie. We gotta move right
smart afo&#8217; noon an&#8217; you ain&#8217; ve&#8217;y spry on dat crutch.&#8221;
Picking up the lame boy, the woman began to issue instructions
for the advance of her forces.</p>

<p>Virginia surveyed the manoeuvering orphans comprehensively.
&#8220;If I could get them all into the car
I would take them for a ride,&#8221; she exclaimed, and then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
&#8220;They can be crowded in, I believe. May they go?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman regarded the girl in great astonishment.
&#8220;Cou&#8217;se dey kin go eff yo&#8217;all wants &#8217;em.&#8221; Her conscience
appeared to demand a further warning. &#8220;Dey
is er powe&#8217;ful mouthy and mischievous lot o&#8217; rascallions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike was disgusted. To be required to act as chauffeur
for a crowd of screaming infants of his own
race was another wound to that dignity so recently
and fearfully lacerated. He submitted protest. &#8220;Dis
yere caah ain&#8217; gwine hol&#8217; all dem chillun. It ain&#8217; no
dray. Dey gwine bus&#8217; de springs smack bang offen
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the car breaks down you can have them fix it
at the garage, Ike. They always have been able to
mend it,&#8221; Virginia told him with great complacency
as she proceeded with her plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef all de chillun stan&#8217; close, &#8217;ceptin fo&#8217; or five
wid li&#8217;l Willie an&#8217; me on de back seat, dey is plenty
room,&#8221; the orphan&#8217;s guardian indicated, greatly pleased
at the prospect of the ride.</p>

<p>The sullen fire of eternal hatred burned in the eye
which Ike turned upon her. He fired his last shot.
&#8220;Miss Virginy, you&#8217; Daddy ain&#8217; want all des yere
chillun in dis caah. He mighty biggoty about whoall
ride in it. Ah &#8217;spects dey is gwine dirty it up sumpin
fierce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who yo&#8217;all call dirty?&#8221; demanded the woman; but
Virginia made peace by an emphatic &#8220;Hush,&#8221; as the
colored orphans were packed into the back of the
machine. With their attendant they filled the entire
space.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>The car moved away as soon as Virginia had taken
her seat by the irritated Ike. They left the town and
sped along country roads. The little negroes, awed
by their new surroundings, became noisy with familiarity
and expressed their joy by screaming.</p>

<p>The young hostess of this strange party was at first
uncomfortable and embarrassed at the clamor of her
small guests, but as she awakened to the enjoyment
she was giving the orphans she forgot herself in their
pleasure.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful ride along the river shore, through
the woods, and then back between great fields of growing
grain the surfaces of which were broken into moving
waves of green at the touch of the summer breeze.</p>

<p>They reentered the town a few minutes before noon
and were almost back to the turn towards the Orphans&#8217;
Home, when far down the street they caught the glitter
of brass and the glow of red. &#8220;Er ban&#8217;, er ban&#8217;,&#8221;
screamed the little negroes.</p>

<p>The enticing strains of melody called to Ike across
the intervening blocks. There was a look of deep
guile in his face, which became regret, as he suggested
to Virginia, &#8220;Des po&#8217; orphants ain&#8217; no chans to heah
fine ban&#8217; music. Ah might circle aroun&#8217; dat minst&#8217;el
ban&#8217; an&#8217; let de chillun lis&#8217;en fo&#8217; er spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Virginia nodded assent, the car shot away,
straight down the street. In a few moments they had
overtaken the marching musicians, the reality of the
poster which had charmed Ike. From them burst
melody which coursed through his veins. As he
drifted away on a sea of syncopated bliss, the car, subconsciously
driven, closed upon the marching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
minstrels. In the midst of a delegation of youth, honoring
the snare and bass drummers, it rolled. Bearing
Virginia and her guests behind the pageant and as an
apparent part thereof, it proceeded towards the center
of the city.</p>

<p>The negro children were clamorous with delight at
the wonderful concentration of humanity, noise, and
excitement. Their screams vied with the band and
their guardian on the rear seat assumed a careless dignity.</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s mind was occupied with the infants. To
her, the onlookers, more numerous as they neared the
business part of town, were the background of a picture.
She was utterly unconscious that the load of
pickaninnies formed a most appropriate part of the
spectacle.</p>

<p>Laughter pealed from the increasing crowds at the
nonsensical behavior of the orphans. In the center of
town, prominent business men were away from their
offices for luncheon. They gazed indifferently at the
marching band, but as the machine approached, they
recognized its monogram, and, attracting the attention
of companions, they burst into shouts of laughter.
Here was the car of wealthy Obadiah Dale, packed with
negro children, chaperoned by his daughter, taking
part in a minstrel parade.</p>

<p>Suddenly upon the sidewalk near the curb, Virginia
espied her father. Regardless of her surroundings, the
girl endeavored to attract his attention by waving her
hand. The pickaninnies joined with shouts, considering
it a pleasant game.</p>

<p>Plunged in thought and heedless of the band, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
increased clamor aroused Obadiah. Incredulity and
amazement, at the sight of his daughter and her company,
held him. An acquaintance approached, spoke
and laughed. Anger flushed the mill owner as he
marked the staring eyes fixed in unveiled amusement
on himself and his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy is over there,&#8211;there.&#8221; She indicated the
place to Ike, delight in her discovery accenting her cry.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, thus rudely torn from his musical
reverie, solaced his disturbed harmoniousness, by smiting
the ears of the crowd and wrecking the sweet tones
of the band, by a discordant honk. Thus soothed, he
attempted to turn towards the sidewalk, but the congested
traffic blocked him and he had to delay a few
moments before he could swing the car over to the
curb.</p>

<p>Obadiah came up. He glared at the assembled orphans
with manifest disapproval and gave gruff tongue
to his astonishment. &#8220;What does this mean? I
don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; he snarled at Virginia.</p>

<p>In the depths of her big blue eyes lay tenderness as
she anxiously searched his cold grey ones for some
sign of sympathetic appreciation. &#8220;Daddy, dear&#8221;&#8211;there
was a note of pride in her manner&#8211;&#8220;these are
orphans from the Lincoln Home. I have had them
out riding all morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pickaninnies acknowledged the introduction
with screams.</p>

<p>This attention added fuel to Obadiah&#8217;s irritation,
&#8220;How are you going to get rid of this bunch?&#8221; he
asked loudly, giving no heed to the listening ears of
guests. &#8220;I want to go home and get my lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>The girl wrinkled her nose in thoughtful consideration
of the social dilemma she faced. The truly resourceful
are never long at a loss. &#8220;You get in here,
Daddy,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;you can hold me on your lap
and we will run over to the Orphans&#8217; Home. We can
leave the children there and go straight home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; snapped Obadiah, &#8220;I won&#8217;t be made
more ridiculous than I have been, today. You must
learn to give thought to others, Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, her happiness faded before his words.
&#8220;I am so sorry. I forgot how time was passing and
I didn&#8217;t mean to get in this big crowd. How will
you get home? What can I do for you, Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he realized that amused faces watched
him as he interviewed his daughter, a lily in a bed of
black tulips. &#8220;Get out of this crowd. Everybody is
laughing at me. I&#8217;ll get home some way,&#8221; he declared
peevishly. &#8220;You get rid of that outfit as soon
as you can,&#8221; he called, as he moved away, apparently
in a hurry to escape the orphans&#8217; company. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see
you at home.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>UNGIVEN ADVICE</span></h2>

<p>Obadiah Dale&#8217;s office was in a modern building.
He considered it the finest in South Ridgefield, but
then&#8211;Obadiah owned it. The proximity of an army
of employees disturbed him. So he had gathered his
principal assistants about him, away from the mill, in
this more peaceful environment.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s personal suite contained three rooms.
His private lair was in the corner. Its windows overlooked
metal cornices, tin roofs and smoke stacks.
The view should have afforded inspiration to sheet
metal workers, and professional atmosphere was available
at all times to such chimney sweeps as called.</p>

<p>The personal staff consisted of Obadiah&#8217;s stenographer,
Mr. Percy Jones, who referred to himself as
the &#8220;Private Secretary&#8221; and was habitually addressed
in discourteous terms by his employer, and a bookkeeper
identified by the name Kelly.</p>

<p>Across the hall was the sanctum of Hezekiah Wilkins,
general attorney for the Dale interests. The
other executive officers of the organization occupied
the rest of the floor.</p>

<p>Certain preparatory sounds evidencing to the discriminating
ear of youth the probability of a band
bursting into melody had reached Mr. Jones. Rising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
hurriedly from his desk in the center of the middle
room of Obadiah&#8217;s suite, he had gone to a window,
and peering down, discovered that the Jubilee Minstrels
were about to favor South Ridgefield with a
parade.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones watched the preparations with interest.
He was a dapper little fellow with thin, dark hair,
who sported a very small mustache with a very great
deal of pride. As much of a dandy as his small salary
would permit, he had indefinite social aspirations, and
rather considered himself a man of much natural culture
and refinement.</p>

<p>His curiosity satisfied, he turned to a door, opposite
to the one which insured privacy to Obadiah, and entered
the domain of Kelly. The bookkeeper was
perched upon a high stool before an equally elevated
desk burdened with the mill owner&#8217;s ledgers. He was
red headed, big and raw boned, clearly designed by
nature for the heaviest of manual labor but by a joke
of fate set to wielding a pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Kelly,&#8211;minstrels,&#8221; thus Mr. Jones advertised
the forthcoming pageant as he lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>The upper part of Kelly&#8217;s person was brilliantly
illuminated by the reflected light of a globe hanging
an inch above his head. &#8220;Where?&#8221; he asked, blinking
about from his area of high illumination into the
shadows of the room as though looking for callers.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the street, you chump. They are going to
parade. As soon as the old man goes, we&#8217;ll hustle out
and look &#8217;em over.&#8221;</p>

<p>A movement in the corner room sent Mr. Jones
scurrying to his desk. From the street sounded the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
staccato taps of a snare drum, rhythmically punctuated
by the boom of the bass, passing up the street.
Obadiah emerged from his room as one marching to
martial music. He broke step like a rooky to tell his
stenographer, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaping to his feet, Mr. Jones bowed profoundly as
his employer departed, his manner filled with the awe
and respect due a man of such wealth and position.
He listened intently until the elevator descended, then
he shouted, &#8220;Get a move on you, in there. He&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bookkeeper appeared, his hat on the back of his
head and struggling into his coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, we can get the elevator on its next trip,&#8221;
urged the stenographer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the rush&#8211;we don&#8217;t want to run into the
old man,&#8221; the bookkeeper demurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a right to eat, ain&#8217;t we? What&#8217;s the
lunch hour for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, who&#8217;s talking about not eating? I don&#8217;t want
the old man&#8217;s face as an appetizer,&#8221; protested Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, he has got you bluffed. You are scared of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bookkeeper shrugged his big shoulders and
laughed. &#8220;Not on your life am I afraid of that old
spider, but I don&#8217;t like him. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old man is a good enough scout when you
know how to handle him,&#8221; boasted Mr. Jones. &#8220;Tell
him where to get off once in awhile and he&#8217;ll eat out
of your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; chuckled Kelly. &#8220;The next time you decide
to call him down, put me wise. I don&#8217;t want to
miss it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;Quit your kidding and come on. You think that
I am shooting hot air. I&#8217;ll show you some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their hasty luncheon was completed when the strains
of music heralding the return of the minstrel show
hurried them forth to the curb to procure suitable places
to watch the parade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kelly, look at the pickaninnies in the automobile
following the band,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Jones, greatly interested.
&#8220;That&#8217;s something new. I never saw it
before.&#8221; Thus he confirmed originality from the
wealth of his own knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the white girl doing there?&#8221; Kelly sought
information at the fountain of wisdom.</p>

<p>The sagacious Mr. Jones was puzzled, but for an instant
only. He elucidated. &#8220;They have a white manager
and that&#8217;s his wife who won&#8217;t black up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The explanation struck Kelly as reasonable and
for the moment it sufficed, as he gave his attention to
the passing machine. &#8220;That&#8217;s a peach of a car,&#8221; he
proclaimed, and in further commendation, &#8220;Gosh, it&#8217;s
as fine as the old man&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it was so close that Mr. Jones was enabled to
place an expert&#8217;s eyes upon it. &#8220;Why,&#8221; gasped that
specialist, astounded by the revelations of his own keen
optic, &#8220;blamed if it ain&#8217;t the old man&#8217;s car and,&#8221; he
stammered in his excitement, &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;It&#8217;s the old
man&#8217;s daughter&#8211;Virginia&#8211;in that minstrel parade.&#8221;</p>

<p>In silent wonder the young men watched the passing
marvel and, turning, followed it as if expecting
further events of an extremely sensational nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, there&#8217;s the old man.&#8221; The eagle eye of
Mr. Jones had picked his employer unerringly from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
amidst the multitude. &#8220;He sees the car,&#8221; the stenographer
continued, as one announcing races, on distant
tracks, to interested spectators. &#8220;Wilkins is kidding
him. He&#8217;s getting sore. We&#8217;d better beat it.&#8221; Regardless
of previous fearlessness, Mr. Jones guided
his companion into the entrance of a building from
which vantage point they watched the meeting of
Obadiah and his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;By crackie, he&#8217;s hot. Everybody is laughing at
him.&#8221; To prove the truth of his own assertion, Mr.
Jones threw back his head and guffawed cruelly at the
embarrassment of his employer.</p>

<p>One o&#8217;clock found the two clerks at their desks.
Obadiah was a punctual man. Always on time himself,
he demanded it of his employees. Today, however,
minutes flew by with no sign of the manufacturer&#8217;s
return.</p>

<p>At one thirty, Mr. Jones entered Kelly&#8217;s room to
confer in regard to this unwonted tardiness. Resting
his elbows upon the bookkeeper&#8217;s desk he projected
his head within the area of light in which his colleague
labored and submitted a sporting proposition.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet my hat that the old man is raising the deuce
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly inspected the illuminated face of the stenographer
with interest, as if the brilliant rays exposed
flaws which he had not previously noted. Disregarding
the wager, he replied with emphasis, &#8220;You said
a mouthful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones displayed marked uneasiness. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised
that he is not back. He had important matters
to attend to.&#8221; The stenographer waxed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
mysterious. &#8220;Only this morning he called me in. &#8216;Mr.
Jones,&#8217; sez he, &#8216;I must have your invaluable assistance,
today, on a matter of great importance. I couldn&#8217;t
get along without your help. Please, don&#8217;t step out
without warning me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently Kelly regarded the stenographer&#8217;s secret
revelations lightly. &#8220;You told him that you didn&#8217;t
have the time?&#8221; he suggested with a grin.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones attempted to frown down unseemly levity
regarding serious matters.</p>

<p>Kelly burst into laughter. &#8220;Gee, if I wasn&#8217;t here
to keep you off the old man, he sure would suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones changed the subject, before such frivolity.
&#8220;He ought to fire that feller Ike. I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s to
blame for the whole thing. The idea of getting a
young lady mixed up in a mess like that. He ought
to be fired.&#8221; Mr. Jones&#8217; soul revolted at the notoriety
which had befallen his employer&#8217;s daughter. He became
thoughtful and then confidential. &#8220;That girl is
a pippin, Kelly. A regular pippin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it.&#8221; The bookkeeper&#8217;s emphasis
spoke volumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever think about her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; admitted Kelly with candor, &#8220;lots of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl lives a lonesome life in that big house
with only the colored servants and her father,&#8221; alleged
the knowing Mr. Jones. &#8220;What fun does she
ever have? The old man thinks that she is only a baby.
If she has a nurse and is taken out every day for an
airing, he imagines nothing else is necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are talking,&#8221; quoth Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the old man had any brains&#8211;&#8221; Mr. Jones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
noted a correction&#8211;&#8220;I mean, if he was a cultured
and refined man, if he was alive&#8211;&#8221; Mr. Jones&#8217;s manner
expressed grave doubt of Obadiah&#8217;s vitality&#8211;&#8220;He
would understand that young people must enjoy
themselves once in awhile.&#8221; Poignant memories of
the mill owner&#8217;s refusal to grant certain hours off for
social purposes embittered the stenographer at this
point in his discourse. He paused. &#8220;If he had any
brains, instead of hanging around and trying to grab
every cent that isn&#8217;t locked in a burglar proof safe, the
old duffer would open up his swell house and spend
some coin. He&#8217;s got plenty of money. It sticks to
him as if his hands were magnets and his fingers suction
cups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say so,&#8221; agreed Kelly, with a vigorous nod.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Jones departed to assure himself
that Obadiah did not surreptitiously draw nigh.
Thus reassured, he returned and vigorously pursued
his scathing arraignment of the absent one. &#8220;If he
had red blood in his veins he&#8217;d have a heart where
that girl is concerned. Why doesn&#8217;t he ever give a
dance for her? If he wasn&#8217;t an old tight wad he&#8217;d
give several a week, have a swell dinner every night
and a theater party each time a decent show comes
to town. He&#8217;d do that thing if he wasn&#8217;t a short
sport. He ought to get a lively bunch of young people
to make his place their social headquarters and tear
things loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me.&#8221; Thus did the laconic Kelly record
his position.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones went on, &#8220;He should give his daughter
the opportunity to enjoy the better things of life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
The stenographer drifted over to a window and fell
to musing. He gave thought to volumes of lighter
literature which had led him to believe that, in well
conducted families of wealth and position, private
secretaries often assumed the responsibilities of social
secretaries or major domos. Turning again to the
bookkeeper, he resumed, &#8220;It takes certain peculiar
qualifications to handle that sort of thing. Everybody
knows that the old man couldn&#8217;t do it. He ought
to come out like a man and admit that he has no conception
of that bigger social life which plays such an
important part in the world today. Then&#8211;&#8221; Mr.
Jones spoke with great meaning&#8211;&#8220;there are those
who understand such matters and could relieve him
of all responsibilities except&#8211;&#8221; Mr. Jones snapped his
fingers as though it was a bagatelle&#8211;&#8220;signing the
checks.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THOSE DARKIES AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>After Obadiah, highly indignant at the presence of
the black orphans, had departed, his car moved slowly
up the street. It stopped at the corner for the policeman&#8217;s
signal. At the edge of the sidewalk stood a
newsboy eating an ice cream cone with great enjoyment.
The shouts of the pickaninnies were stilled at
the pleasing spectacle of a fellow man partaking of
food. Every eye watched the disappearing cone as
if fascinated by some novel mechanical process.</p>

<p>The unusual silence aroused Virginia from uneasy
thoughts of her father. Following the eyes of her
guests she caught the common target as the last bite
disappeared, and noted that the lips of the black company
moved sympathetically coincident with its departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;These children will be late for lunch?&#8221; worried
the young hostess, awakening to the requirements of
the hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m,&#8221; the woman confessed with indifference.
&#8220;It ain&#8217; no mattah.&#8221; From outward appearances the
infants took issue upon the question, deeming it one
of grave concern. &#8220;Dey eats at noon but ah fix &#8217;em
up er snack w&#8217;en we git back.&#8221; The orphans registered
relief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;How would they like an ice cream cone?&#8221; suggested
Virginia.</p>

<p>The infants awaited the verdict in breathless anticipation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah guesses dey lak it mighty well.&#8221; The woman
looked about her at the upturned mouths even as in a
nest of fledgeling blackbirds. The financial extravagance
daunted her. &#8220;Yo&#8217;all mought git one fo&#8217; each
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sore disappointment depressed the fledgelings.</p>

<p>Virginia sensed the prevalent dejection. &#8220;No,&#8221; she
decided, &#8220;each child shall have one. Go on to Vivian&#8217;s,
Ike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Vivian maintained an establishment for
the distribution of those mild refreshments appealing
to youth. His fastidious soul endeavored to foster
the delicate things of life. He dealt in sugars and
syrups in preference to lard or kerosene. This spirit
prevailed in his public parlors. Golden rays reflected
in dazzling brilliancy in many mirrors from gilded
grills. It was meet that in such a temple only the elect
should partake of ambrosia. This thought exuded
from every pore of Mr. Vivian. At times he spoke
of it.</p>

<p>The world accepts a man at his own value. So,
South Ridgefield appraised Mr. Vivian&#8217;s resort at his
own valuation; but by no means does this mean that
his clientele was limited. Far from it. The youth
of South Ridgefield were not modest in their self-esteem.
In spite of individual embarrassment, when
first brought under the influence of the Vivian presence
and decorations, they gathered daily in great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
numbers in the Vivian parlors, that the world might bear
witness, through their presence, to their elevated social
status.</p>

<p>Indeed, certain hardy and desperate spirits did, by
continued presence and notable consumption of wares,
become so bold that they dared to address the proprietor
as &#8220;Bill,&#8221; and risked mild pleasantries as that the
nectar was &#8220;rotten dope,&#8221; or that, through error, a
&#8220;dash er onion or sumpin&#8217;&#8221; had been introduced into
their sacchariferous cup. Such familiarity was for
the few. Did not eye witnesses support tradition in
evidence of the casting forth of the unworthy from
the Vivian portals?</p>

<p>Had not reputable bibbers testified that certain dirty
faced urchins, essaying early adventures in trade and
tendering but five coppers instead of the eight, well
known to be the post war value of the cone, been
driven into the street with loud objurgation?</p>

<p>Likewise, there was the memorable episode of the
drunken tramp. Stumbling into this resort of innocent
youth under the belief that it was a saloon, he
was summarily ejected by the police. For a time, a
splintered mirror gave silent testimony to this banishment.
It evidenced the casting of a root beer mug at
the white coated soda dispenser by the vulgar varlet,
obsessed by the delusion that he was enjoying the
more thrilling sport of heaving a beer stein at a bartender.</p>

<p>But by far the greater number of refusals of service,
with its corollary of altercation and throwings out,
had to do with negroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t serving &#8217;em in my place,&#8221; Mr. Vivian had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
proclaimed, with a frank disregard of at least the spirit
of the fifteenth amendment.</p>

<p>The sweets dispensed by Mr. Vivian drew the black
people as molasses does the fly, and South Ridgefield
had a large percentage of negro residents. For a time
hardly a day passed without noisy wrangles. Comfortably
seated in full view and hearing of such disputes,
the elect were greatly edified thereby. Of late,
such disturbances had decreased, and, as they had ended
always in favor of the confectioner, he felt assured
that he had settled the race issue in his own place at
least.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian waited today behind his marble topped
counter and supervised his numerous assistants.
Through the front windows he watched the multitude
which had assembled to view the minstrel parade disperse.
He observed an influx of gilded youth over
his threshold. One listening to explanations would
have gathered that the unusual number present was not
due to interest in such low concerns as minstrel bands.
Through untoward events the pageant had obtruded
itself, as it were, into blasé vision.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian&#8217;s eyes, as has been suggested, rested
upon the street. Into his optical angle rolled the Dale
car. It was well known to the confectioner. Often
it paused for long periods before his place while Virginia
refreshed herself within. It was his delight, at
these times, to greet the maiden with profound respect,
as his heart swelled with pride. The car of Obadiah
Dale, the wealthiest, and in consequence, in Mr.
Vivian&#8217;s judgment, the peak of the town&#8217;s social
strata, awaited without. Within the house of Vivian,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
the heiress partook of Vivian products. What could
be more appropriate?</p>

<p>The spectacle of the big machine given up to the
conveyance of this small maiden had always pleased
Mr. Vivian. There was a cavalier disregard of the
cost of gasoline, oil, and tires which appealed to him.
Today, the large passenger list astonished him, and,
even as the number impressed him, their aspect amazed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Negroes,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;coming <i>here</i>!&#8221; There are
moments in every life which have far-reaching consequences.
The confectioner faced one.</p>

<p>The car stopped at the Vivian door. The glad
shouts of infants penetrated the halls set apart for the
fashionable. They offended the ears of the elect.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is Virginia Dale and those colored kids with
whom she was making a spectacle of herself in the
minstrel parade,&#8221; sneered an excited girl. &#8220;If she
brings them in here, I&#8217;ll leave and never come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; a man of the world, of sixteen,
calmed her. &#8220;Old Viv won&#8217;t stand for any foolishness.
You watch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia Dale has lived so long in that big house
with only colored people that she likes them for
friends,&#8221; declared another girl contemptuously. &#8220;Too
good to associate with any of the young people of this
town, she parades around like that. I think it is disgusting
myself and I would tell her so, for very little.&#8221;</p>

<p>These and similar remarks filled the ears of the perplexed
proprietor. He decided that whatever was
done in this instance had better be done, contrary to
his usual practice, beyond the hearing of the elect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>He rushed out to the waiting car. A smile was
upon his face but it was not his usual one of hearty
welcome. It spoke of hidden pain and anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Vivian,&#8221; Virginia courteously
greeted the dispenser of toothsome delicacies. &#8220;I
want you to meet these little people from the Lincoln
Home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cast a glance into the nest of the blackbirds. It
lacked that interest with which new friends should be
greeted. He felt the curious glances of the chosen,
impinging against his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are hungry, Mr. Vivian. We have had a
long ride and the children missed their lunch watching
the parade. Each of us wants the nicest ice cream cone
you can make. Seventeen, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cones!&#8221; Light dawned in Mr. Vivian&#8217;s darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring them out, please?&#8221; Virginia begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out?&#8221; The clouds which had veiled the true Mr.
Vivian rolled aside. Came sunshine and gladsome
welcome.</p>

<p>In a moment the confectioner was behind his counter
urging his assistants to diligence. In joyous relief,
he shouted, &#8220;Make &#8217;em big, boys. Make &#8217;em big!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, disregarding the feelings of the staring elect,
Mr. Vivian hastened forth, bearing a box of cones.
In a moment, with his kindest smile, encouraged by
Virginia, he delivered with his own hand, to each infant,
one of his products.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor things. I don&#8217;t suppose orphans get ice
cream cones very often, do they?&#8221; Virginia asked the
woman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>&#8220;Some ain&#8217; nevah had none afo&#8217;, Ah bets. Has
you, chillun? Who had one?&#8221; Six worldly wise
infants voted in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian was stirred deeply by this information.
That human beings were permitted to arrive at such an
age without experience of cones struck him as an economic
mistake. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;They eat them as though they were used to them,&#8221;
laughed Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, as he watched the mouths of the
blackbirds wag in solemn unison. Another thought
struck him. &#8220;You have had these orphans out for a
ride all morning, Miss Dale?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a grand time, too.
Haven&#8217;t we, children?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mouths were too full for utterance but there was a
unanimous bobbing of heads.</p>

<p>When Virginia opened her purse to pay for the
cones, Mr. Vivian, after inspecting the tendered currency
for a moment, submitted a proposal. &#8220;Miss
Dale, would you object if I presented the cones to the
children? I would be glad to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a look of understanding in Virginia&#8217;s
eyes as she answered him, &#8220;I know how you feel about
it. I can&#8217;t let you do it today, though, Mr. Vivian.
You see, it is my treat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Motionless as a statue, Mr. Vivian stood before the
door of his establishment and watched the machine depart.
As it disappeared a look of great approval
rested upon his countenance. &#8220;There goes a darn
fine girl,&#8221; he muttered. He threw back his fat shoulders
and worked them as though a great load had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
recently removed from them. &#8220;Thank heaven,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;she didn&#8217;t take it into her head to unload that
outfit in my place.&#8221; He scratched his head. &#8220;What
would I have done?&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN</span></h2>

<p>It was past one o&#8217;clock when Virginia left the colored
children at the Orphans&#8217; Home. The purchase of the
cones had detained them much longer than she had anticipated.
Now, rid of her guests, she remembered
her meeting with her father. Appreciating with dismay
how the minutes had flown, she considered it advisable
to return home as soon as practicable that
rough water might be lubricated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, Ike,&#8221; she told the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Now, Ike needed little encouragement in this matter.
It delighted him exceedingly to find excuse to
unloose the surplus power of the fast machine. Tantalizing
qualms which only Serena&#8217;s cooking could
quiet likewise beset him. It was his custom to lunch
early and abundantly.</p>

<p>Ike hurried. In a moment the car was rushing along
one of South Ridgefield&#8217;s residential streets at a high
rate of speed. Virginia&#8217;s thoughts rehearsed the events
of the morning. Those of the chauffeur anticipated
his delayed repast.</p>

<p>They approached a corner. The hoarse honk of
a horn sounded from the intersecting street. At the
crossing came an instantaneous perception of a man
approaching at high speed upon a motorcycle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
trying to dodge. The sickening sensation of impending
peril held the girl as the emergency brake squealed. A
heavy shock at the back of the automobile seemed to
lift it. Virginia screamed. The motorcycle rider
half dove, half tumbled out from the back of the big
car and crumpled an inert and senseless heap in the
street.</p>

<p>The Dale car stopped almost at the instant of the
shock. Seeming to fall from his seat, Ike ran back
and stared for a second at the upset motorcycle and
then hurried to the recumbent figure.</p>

<p>A bystander rushed out and joined the chauffeur,
crying, &#8220;Is he dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike, filled with personal woes, took no heed of the
inquiry. &#8220;Run squa&#8217;e into me. Smack bang. Done
knock er big dent in ma caah,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>Luckily the bystander was a man of action rather
than words. He gave attention to the stricken one.
&#8220;Get the doctor, over there,&#8221; he commanded sharply,
pointing to a white house nearby.</p>

<p>Ike disappeared on the run.</p>

<p>For seconds which seemed hours, Virginia, held by
fright, could not move. Her eyes, wide with horror,
stared back at the motionless motorcyclist. His
flattened figure resembled a bundle of old clothes
dropped carelessly in the roadway. Certain that the
man was dead, the terrible thought came to the girl
that she was responsible for it. She could hear herself
saying, &#8220;Hurry, Ike.&#8221; It made her frantic,
she could not sit still and yet she wondered if she had
the strength to move. In a moment, she found herself
standing. Hardly knowing what she did, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
climbed from the car and moved slowly towards the
figure lying in the dust. She watched it fearfully, as
if it might suddenly leap at her. Now she saw the
face. How dreadfully white it was. Surely he was
dead. The pity of this great fellow lying helpless in
the street moved her strangely. The pathos of his
weakness wrung her heart.</p>

<p>The bystander removed his coat intending to make
a pillow of it. Guessing his purpose, Virginia hastened
to the car and brought back a cushion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, that will be better,&#8221; he told her. Taking
the cushion, he held it irresolutely as though planning
how best to use it.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I help?&#8221; To Virginia it seemed that the
words came of their own accord. She doubted if she
had the strength to do anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would, please? When I lift his head, will
you push the cushion under?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl dropped upon her knees in the dust of the
roadway. It brought her face very near to that of
the unconscious man. She noticed that he was young,
not much older than herself. When the cushion was
placed it lifted his head into an awkward position.
Readjusting the cushion, Virginia pushed it too far.
The motorcyclist&#8217;s head slid over and rested against
her knee. For an instant she hesitated and then, making
a pillow of her lap, she very gently lifted his head
into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better. That&#8217;s the stuff,&#8221; approved the
bystander. Noticing her pallor, he added, &#8220;If you
can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;I will be all right,&#8221; she hesitatingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
reassured him. Yet, at the moment, she was not at
all sure of herself. Was she not holding the head of
a dead youth in her lap? It had shifted and a rivulet
of blood oozed from a small wound in the forehead,
formerly hidden. A deathly sickness swept the girl.
But even as it seized her came a determination to
fight her feelings and conquer them. She would not
faint.</p>

<p>The motorcyclist groaned. Virginia almost dropped
his head in alarm. He wasn&#8217;t dead, but certainly that
melancholy sound marked the passing of his soul.
Other groans followed of such grievous quality that
she was sure each one was his last.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming around, I believe,&#8221; declared the bystander.</p>

<p>The words reawakened hope in Virginia&#8217;s breast.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he dead?&#8221; she murmured gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The voice came from her lap.</p>

<p>Her startled blue eyes dropped. Two wide open
black eyes looked up into them wonderingly for an
instant and the lids closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; moaned the stricken one in unmistakable
language.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s praying,&#8221; thought Virginia and solemnly
bowed her head.</p>

<p>Ike returned, followed soon by a doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s regained consciousness,&#8221; the bystander told
the medical man.</p>

<p>The physician knelt by the injured youth. He listened
to his heart and then started to lift an eyelid
when both lids opened so wide that Virginia was enabled
to confirm her previous impression that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
motorcyclist&#8217;s eyes were black. The doctor felt the
man&#8217;s body and the groans redoubled as he touched one
of the legs. The medical man straightened up. &#8220;His
head seems to be all right. There is a fracture of the
right leg and probably a rib or two broken. He is
lucky to get off so easy. He will be a mass of bruises,
too, I suppose,&#8221; he announced. He glanced curiously
at the waiting car and then at Virginia and went on,
&#8220;You are Obadiah Dale&#8217;s daughter, are you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she nodded her assent, he asked, &#8220;How did the
accident happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was to blame,&#8221; confessed Virginia, her eyes filling
with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t driving the car?&#8221; he argued sympathetically
and when she admitted it, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how
you can be in fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was though, doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her an enveloping professional glance.
The pale face and the flood of tears fighting to break
their dams did not escape him. &#8220;You are suffering
from the shock of the accident. You have been under
a strain and are nervous and unstrung.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike considered this an appropriate moment to make
public outcry. &#8220;Dat man was to blame. Ran smack
into me. Lak to punch er hole in de tiah wid &#8217;is haid.
Ah gwine look fo&#8217; er punkcher,&#8221; he assured the crowd
which had assembled.</p>

<p>This attempt to win public favor at the expense of
a semi-unconscious opponent filled the doctor with indignation.
&#8220;You talk like a fool,&#8221; he informed the
chauffeur. &#8220;Without inquiring into the matter I conclude
that you are to blame. You help me carry this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
man under the trees and make him comfortable until
I can call an ambulance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The snap judgment of the medical man apparently
struck Ike as of uncontrovertible accuracy, because
he prepared in silence to assist in caring for the injured
until Virginia suggested,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not take the man in our machine and get
him to the hospital so much quicker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; agreed the doctor. He eyed Ike
sternly. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of speed now. There
has been too much of that around here in my opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r,&#8221; the chauffeur made illogical response.
&#8220;Ah ain&#8217; no speeder. Ah is de carefles&#8217; drivah in dis
yere town. Safety fust. Dat&#8217;s ma motta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Appearances are against you,&#8221; the doctor snorted
as he prepared a rough splint to protect the leg of the
motorcyclist during his removal.</p>

<p>They placed the youth in the Dale car, the doctor
holding him in his arms but using a middle seat to
support the lower part of the body. Ike pulled down
the other seat and, at a sign from the physician, Virginia
took it.</p>

<p>As they slowly left the scene of the accident, the
girl noticed that the arm of the youth nearest to her
swung helplessly at every jolt of the car. Taking the
hand in her own, she lifted it into her lap. When
she released it, there was a faint movement as if the
fingers searched for her own. Knowing him to be
suffering, Virginia regrasped his hand and it seemed
to her that there came an answering pressure as of
appreciation.</p>

<p>Yet woe descended anew upon the girl. The youth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
could not walk. He could not talk. As she looked
at his grotesquely postured body, she became convinced
that he was dying. The doctor&#8217;s remarks were
to cheer her. No one could forecast the results of
such an accident. The victim might pass away in the
car. He was so young to die, a mere boy. She had
killed him. Such thoughts were overwhelming her
with fear when they reached the hospital.</p>

<p>In the reception room of the institution, she awaited
in dread the outcome of a more thorough examination.
As she looked about her, there was nothing in the furnishing
of the apartment to distinguish it from thousands
of others except the faint, sickening odor of ether
which told its own story.</p>

<p>A most attractive young woman in a nurse&#8217;s uniform
came across the hall from a small office opposite.
&#8220;Were you with the emergency case Dr. Millard
brought?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Virginia thought the blonde curls, beneath the cap,
very attractive. Also she approved of the hazel eyes.
They seemed sympathetic and the overwrought girl
longed for that. &#8220;I came with a motorcyclist who was
hurt. I don&#8217;t know the doctor&#8217;s name,&#8221; she responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can give me the information about the patient
I will fill out his card.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia looked at the nurse in astonishment.
&#8220;Why I don&#8217;t know him. I never met him until he
ran into our car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A violent introduction,&#8221; giggled the nurse, and
then, more seriously, &#8220;I am glad that it is not your
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Husband</i>,&#8221; gasped Virginia, &#8220;on a <i>motorcycle</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
Her face reddened in an embarrassment the absurdity
of which provoked her.</p>

<p>The nurse broke into a gale of soft laughter.
&#8220;They come in automobiles, on motorcycles and on
foot. Evidently, you don&#8217;t care for those on motorcycles.&#8221;
She considered a moment. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame
you. He would have so many accidents that you
would never know whether you were wife or widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was uncomfortable. The strain of the
most exciting day in her life was telling. The mischievous
eyes of the nurse were not helping matters.
&#8220;I think that I am quite young to be married,&#8221; the
girl announced with a prim dignity meant to suppress
this frivolous person.</p>

<p>That sophisticated young woman shook anew with
amusement. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Have a look at
our maternity ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shot went wide of the mark with Virginia.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, with rapturous interest, &#8220;I&#8217;d
love to. That&#8217;s where you keep the babies, isn&#8217;t it?
I adore them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were speaking of husbands, not babies, you
know.&#8221; The irrepressible nurse persisted. &#8220;They are
closely related but not the same thing. That is, unless
the wife, as many of them do, insists upon making
a baby of her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Husbands! Babies! Where was this strange conversation
leading? Again an annoyed Virginia felt
herself flush beneath the amused eyes of this very complacent
young person. With a rush, horrible thoughts
of the youth upstairs, surely suffering, possibly dying,
through her fault, obsessed her. Yet this nurse could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
look at one with hazel eyes dancing with merriment.
The mill owner&#8217;s daughter whirled to a window, but,
regardless of her efforts, the tears came.</p>

<p>She heard the nurse move. In a moment a hand
touched her shoulder and a kind voice whispered,
&#8220;Dearie, you are all broken up, aren&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s a
shock from the accident. I should have remembered.
Let me get you something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8211;no,&#8221; protested Virginia, dissolved in tears.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not medicine I need. Oh, if I could only be sure
that poor fellow isn&#8217;t going to die. I will never have
a happy moment the rest of my life if he does.&#8221; She
raised her tear drenched face. &#8220;I wanted to make
people happy, not to bring sorrow or trouble to
any one. And now,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve killed a
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, girlie. You couldn&#8217;t kill a flea, let
alone a man. Accidents will happen. We get hundreds
of such cases every month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get motorcyclists though. They are
injured while riding at fearful speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, we do. I don&#8217;t mean to criticise your
friend but most motorcyclists are dreadfully reckless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t my friend. I told you that I don&#8217;t know
him,&#8221; grieved Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why worry so, then? I heard the doctor say that
it was not a serious case myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was concealing something. Anyway, it is
wrong of us to say unkind things about the poor fellow
when he has no friends to help him,&#8221; Virginia concluded
with a note of defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Have</i> we?&#8221; the nurse responded, &#8220;I think that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
said,&#8211;you may remember&#8211;that motorcyclists are
reckless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; sobbed the unhappy girl, &#8220;I thought it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t care about it, anyway,&#8221; argued the
nurse soothingly. &#8220;Cheer up, he&#8217;ll soon be well. I
never remember a motorcyclist dying in this hospital.
They are either killed outright,&#8221; she explained in a
matter of fact tone, &#8220;or they soon recover. They
have so many accidents learning to ride, I suppose, that
they get toughened. I don&#8217;t mean that they are tough
fellows,&#8221; she explained hastily, fearful that Virginia
might deem the remark unkind. &#8220;I mean that one
must be young, and strong, and hard, to run one of
the things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s tears had ceased to flow. &#8220;I should
think that a motorcyclist would have to be&#8211;quick&#8211;and
graceful,&#8221; she interrupted, and then ended, &#8220;&#8211;and
very brave,&#8221; being, evidently much uplifted by
the nurse&#8217;s remarks.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued the very observant attendant of
the sick, &#8220;I should think that they would have to be
very strong and healthy, perfectly nerveless, and,&#8221; she
smiled, &#8220;not a bit fastidious to ride a motorcycle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s face bore a look of mild reproof which
melted away as she joined in the hearty laugh of the
nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going up stairs,&#8221; resumed that energetic person
cheerfully, &#8220;and see your motorcyclist. In a
minute, I will be back able to assure you that he is not
seriously injured.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the girl waited, the quiet of the great building
depressed her. To her came the thought that it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
a place of weariness, pain, suffering. The hall before
her was the highway along which men and women
passed on their way to those white bed battle-grounds
beyond. Through hours, and days of weariness and
suffering the combat dragged its weary length or moved
in strenuous actions, short and sharp, towards victory,
with the joyous return of the pale and weakened warrior
to loved ones, home, friends, and all that makes
life worth living, or else&#8211;</p>

<p>A door opened above stairs. Something very like a
smothered laugh echoed and the soft pad of rubber
soles came on the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; the nurse reassured Virginia, as
she reentered the room. &#8220;He&#8217;s perfectly conscious
and the doctor says that he sees no reason why he
should not get along nicely.&#8221; Her manner became very
professional as she went on, &#8220;Your motorcyclist has
a fractured leg, three fractured ribs, and many
bruises.&#8221; She shrugged her shoulders deprecatingly,
&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing! I think that it is dreadful.&#8221; Virginia
displayed indications of renewed agitation.</p>

<p>The nurse made haste to comfort her, &#8220;Remember,
I have seen him. That young man may be brittle but
he&#8217;ll mend fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will suffer so,&#8221; worried Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not after his leg is set. Of course he will be
in some pain for a few days but that will soon pass.&#8221;
The nurse giggled. &#8220;Right now he has a bad headache
from striking either your car or the street with his
head. It must be made of extraordinarily strong material.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>Virginia gave no heed to the concluding sentence.
A look of alarm spread over her face. &#8220;He struck the
car an awful blow. It fairly lifted it. Was that his
head?&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; admitted the dancing eyed nurse. &#8220;His
headache is severe. But he&#8217;ll be over that in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another matter of anxiety recurred to the girl.
&#8220;How&#8217;s his fever?&#8221; she troubled, her eyes big with
pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fever!&#8221; Surprise claimed the nurse as its own.
&#8220;Now what ever put that into your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I held his hand when we brought him here. It
was very hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; admitted the nurse with a solemnity of
tone which belied her tell-tale orbs. &#8220;What a little
helper you <i>were</i>. You held the patient&#8217;s hand, and,
discovering it to be warm, you believed him dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it strange?&#8221; Virginia gravely pursued her
own line of thought. &#8220;It seemed to me that he wanted
me to hold his hand, so I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind girl,&#8221; the nurse complimented her, and then,
as from a wealth of experience, explained, &#8220;I never
knew a man who disliked to hold hands. Certainly a
motorcyclist would have no compunctions about it.
Don&#8217;t worry about fever in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are laughing at me again. You love to tease
me,&#8221; protested Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it after seeing that motorcyclist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you laugh about him? Poor fellow,
he suffers so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose he does, but his appearance does not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
draw sympathy. They&#8217;ve dressed him up in pink pajamas.
He&#8217;s a great big fellow and his eyes&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are black,&#8221; announced Virginia with great assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but how on earth did you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looked up at me,&#8221; Virginia confessed soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looked up at you? Please tell me when? While
you were holding his hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The girl spoke with great gentleness, as if
in a dream she reënacted the scene she described.
&#8220;His head was lying in my lap and suddenly he opened
his eyes and looked up at me for a moment&#8211;and
closed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse choked with suppressed laughter. &#8220;I
thought,&#8221; she rippled, &#8220;that it was a collision of vehicles,
not of hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How very silly,&#8221; thought Virginia, and regarding
the nurse coldly, she said aloud, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go now. I am
sorry to have been so much trouble to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unmoved by the change in the mood of the visitor,
the nurse accompanied her to the door. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
coming back to see your patient?&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I should,&#8221; Virginia mused. Her coolness
towards the nurse melted. &#8220;It would be dreadfully
embarrassing to visit a strange man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can help you. I go back to ward duty tomorrow
and will have charge of the surgical cases. I&#8217;ll know
him by the time you call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be fine. I&#8217;ll bring him something to
eat.&#8221; A further courtesy occurred to Virginia.
&#8220;Would you let him know, please, that I waited to
be sure that he was as comfortable as possible?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>&#8220;That has been done,&#8221; the nurse told her. &#8220;When
I was up stairs I explained to him that you were waiting,
in almost your very words.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curiosity of her sex beset the mill owner&#8217;s daughter.
&#8220;Did he say anything about it?&#8221; she questioned.</p>

<p>Great merriment, promptly subdued, shook the
nurse. &#8220;I should hardly call it &#8216;anything.&#8217; Of
course, I could not question him in his condition. I
caught two words. Perhaps I misunderstood them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said&#8221;&#8211;again the nurse was shaken by concealed
amusement&#8211;&#8220;something which sounded to
me like&#8221;&#8211;she hesitated to regain control of her
feelings&#8211;&#8220;Some chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; sympathized compassionate Virginia.
&#8220;He is hungry. Serena fries chicken deliciously,
and he shall have some of it.&#8221; As she hurried
away, she wondered what it was that had amused
the nurse so much that she could not overcome a final
outburst.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>IKE EXPLAINS</span></h2>

<p>Obadiah Dale gave unusual thought to his daughter
during a period following the minstrel parade.
This attention was due primarily to the appearance
of Virginia as a seeming part of the pageant. It was
due secondarily, and consequently in ever increasing
force as the minutes passed, to the girl&#8217;s unexplained
delay in returning home to lunch.</p>

<p>Immediately upon his arrival, Obadiah had attempted
to elicit from Serena all information in her
possession concerning orphans and minstrels. His approach
to the subject was craftily obscured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the car. Virginia not home, yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r. She orter bin back er long time ergo.&#8221;
From Serena&#8217;s appearance one would have judged her
deeply aggrieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She tek er li&#8217;l ride. Ain&#8217;t she bin at yo&#8217;all&#8217;s office?&#8221;</p>

<p>Serena was conscious that her speed regulations, literally
interpreted and conscientiously obeyed by Ike,
might be responsible for the delayed return of the absent
ones. She was aware, that regardless of the real
reason, Ike, constitutionally, would not be adverse to
transferring all blame to her. She deemed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
advantageous, therefore, to submit her defence before the
arrival of the complainant and thus win the sympathetic
support of the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah tole dat Ike to drive mo&#8217;e cafful. Ah ain&#8217;
wantin&#8217; Miss Virginy broke up &#8217;count o&#8217; his foolishness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were safe enough when I saw them down
town. As far as I could make out they had been
following a minstrel band about,&#8221; Obadiah informed
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minst&#8217;el band!&#8221; Serena lifted up her voice loudly.
&#8220;Dat&#8217;s Ike. Wot inte&#8217;est dat chil&#8217; got in er ole minst&#8217;el
band. It sure is dat fool Ike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had a negro woman and a lot of negro children
in the back of the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black woman an&#8217; chillun,&#8221; shouted the old negress.
&#8220;Howcum dey in dat caah? Ah axes you
dat?&#8221; Serena&#8217;s temper was rising. &#8220;Dat fool boy
Ike done fill up dat caah wid trash. Yas&#8217;r. Whar
was dey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Following that band down the middle of Main
Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Main Street, wid all de high tone folks er
lookin&#8217; at ma po&#8217; li&#8217;l honey chil&#8217; er packed in wid er
bunch o&#8217; trash er laughin&#8217; an&#8217; er hollerin&#8217; at er minst&#8217;el
band.&#8221; Serena became almost inarticulate in her
anger.</p>

<p>Obadiah kicked angrily at the rug in front of him.
Again he remembered the smiles of the crowd.
Gruffly dismissing the servant, he watched her depart,
every line of her body quivering with indignation and
muttering dire threats at Ike.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>The manufacturer dropped into a chair and attempted
to read a newspaper but he could not keep
his mind from the episode of the morning. It had
been an absurd affair. His sense of personal dignity
rebelled at his daughter being entangled in such a
thing. The thought came that Virginia was only a
child who had become involved in an escapade of Ike&#8217;s
which every one had already forgotten.</p>

<p>He settled himself more comfortably but the picture
of the parade would not depart from his thoughts.
Obadiah could not stand ridicule and those laughing
faces danced before him. That child argument was
unsatisfactory, too. Virginia had appeared quite proud
of the load of colored children when he had talked to
her. She didn&#8217;t look the child part, either. To the
contrary she seemed quite mature&#8211;almost a woman.
With a start, he remembered his daughter&#8217;s age.
&#8220;Confound it,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;she is a woman. She
should behave as one. She must learn to have some
regard for my dignity and to uphold my position in
this town.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose, looked at his watch, and, striding out upon
the porch, gazed anxiously down the street. As he
watched, there came a distant honk of familiar note
and in a few moments his car turned in through the
gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you so late?&#8221; roared Obadiah before
the machine stopped.</p>

<p>Virginia leaped out as the car paused and running
up the steps threw her arms about her father. &#8220;Oh
Daddy,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;I have been so frightened.&#8221;
Laying her head against his arm, she shuddered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s voice was cutting,
sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;We almost killed a man. We broke his legs and
ribs and gave him a terrible headache. We had to
take him to the hospital where he is suffering dreadfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat man done knock er big dent in dis yere caah
wid his haid,&#8221; proclaimed Ike. &#8220;Ran slap bang into
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of the chauffeur&#8217;s well remembered
voice, Serena, as a privileged member of the household,
returned to the porch. Approaching Virginia
who had drawn an arm of her father about herself, the
old negress patted the girl reassuringly upon the shoulder
and pledged revenge. &#8220;Nev&#8217; mine, honey chil&#8217;,
nev&#8217; mind, ah gwine &#8217;tend to dat fool, Ike, presen&#8217;ly.&#8221;
Hurrying to the end of the porch she glared down at
the chauffeur as if he were the root of all evil in that
vicinity. &#8220;Wot you mean er takin&#8217; er woman an&#8217; &#8217;er
fambly in dat caah wid ma honey chil&#8217; an&#8217; er runnin&#8217;
ovah er ban&#8217; an&#8217; er killin&#8217; er minst&#8217;el man? &#8217;Splain
youse&#8217;f, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike was puzzled to identify the victim of his alleged
manslaughter under the conditions named.
&#8220;Wot minst&#8217;el man? Ah ain&#8217; kill no minst&#8217;el man a
tall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who dat done dent yo&#8217;all&#8217;s caah?&#8221; cried the accusing
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;How ah gwine tell if dat man wot bre&#8217;k hisse&#8217;f up
on ma caah is er minst&#8217;el man? Ah ain&#8217; ax &#8217;im. Ah
ain&#8217; kill no man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who dat woman an&#8217; her fambly you &#8217;vite into dat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
caah? Wot mar&#8217;ied woman is yo&#8217;all makin&#8217; up to?
Wot&#8217;s de name o&#8217; dat frien&#8217;, wid chillun?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike had to suffer much that morning. He writhed
under this new inquisition which displayed a tendency
to besmirch his reputation. No love light glowed in
the porcupine&#8217;s eyes but hatred, intense and eternal,
flashed from them, and he bristled as he made forceful
denial. &#8220;Dat female sco&#8217;pion ain&#8217; no frien&#8217; o&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before such dislike, who could suspect? Where
dwelt such frankness? Who could doubt? Yet,
Serena, conjecturing that a more complete understanding
of the case might insure some interesting developments,
excused him with words of warning, &#8220;You
ain&#8217; nevah kep&#8217; nothin&#8217; f&#8217;on me, no time.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Obadiah had heard his daughter&#8217;s story of the
accident, his mind reverted to the minstrel parade.
&#8220;You seem to have had a very strenuous morning,
Virginia,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;When we met, you had
quite a load of passengers with you. Tell me about
them.&#8221; He wanted to know how those orphans got
into the car.</p>

<p>Virginia was in the midst of her description of the
morning&#8217;s events when her father interrupted,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you take those negro children for a
ride? What made you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you understand, Daddy? Those poor little
darkies were frightened almost out of their wits
by our car. They cried, and they looked so forlorn.
The walk is their big pleasure each week. We spoiled
it in a way, today, and I tried to make up for it.&#8221;
She was lost in thought for a moment and then went
on. &#8220;Think of it! Those children are shut up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
within the walls of that institution every minute of
the time except for that weekly walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with that? Where else would
you keep them? They can&#8217;t run loose upon the
streets.&#8221; Obadiah wished to bring his daughter to a
reasonable and sensible view of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Daddy, the orphans can&#8217;t be allowed
to run wild. That would never do. But that makes
it no less hard for them to be shut up in that yard
year after year with only a walk now and then for a
change.&#8221; She looked appealingly at him. &#8220;How
would you like to be shut up in a yard all of the time,
Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah almost shuddered. The thought of being
confined in an inclosure was repulsive to him. It savored
of the penalties prescribed in certain anti-trust
laws of which he had an uncomfortable knowledge.
He would have gladly eliminated the question of restraint,
but not being able to, asked, &#8220;How can you
help it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia gleefully clinched her argument. &#8220;Take
the orphans out oftener and take them riding so that
they can go farther than their little legs can carry
them. I did the last thing, Daddy, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah saw, and, admitting the strength of his
daughter&#8217;s argument to himself, recognized that it had
logical strength as a plea for a series of rides. He
dropped the matter promptly and in this was assisted
by the gong calling them to a belated luncheon.</p>

<p>Virginia, because of the excitement of the morning,
had little appetite. She watched her father for a time
and then her eyes took on a deeper blue as, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
averting her gaze, she drifted away into one of those
mysterious musings of girlhood.</p>

<p>He gulped his food hastily as if he had a train to
catch. &#8220;I should be back,&#8221; he fretted. &#8220;My time is
worth money. You must learn to be considerate of
others, Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shadow of unhappiness veiled the face of
dreams as the girl started at his words. &#8220;I am very
thoughtless, I am afraid, Daddy,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
shall try to be more careful.&#8221; And then in a whisper
so low that he could not hear it, she continued, &#8220;It
would make mother unhappy to know that I was that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should overcome your faults, particularly
your thoughtlessness in regard to others,&#8221; he grumbled,
and immediately changed the subject. &#8220;Do you
know the name of the fellow who ran into you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He considered a moment. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you bother about
it.&#8221; He gave her a smile and the traces of her unhappiness
faded before it. &#8220;I will have some one call
up the hospital. I must take the matter up with Wilkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honey, chil&#8217;, ain&#8217; yo&#8217;all gwine res&#8217; you&#8217;se&#8217;f dis
afternoon?&#8221; Serena demanded, as they arose from the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute, Serena, I want to ask Daddy something.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hurried after him. There was almost a trace
of embarrassment in her voice, as she asked, &#8220;Daddy,
may I go to the hospital tomorrow and visit that
man?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;What?&#8221; Obadiah was surprised. &#8220;Why on
earth should you want to do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I should. I told Ike to hurry, as I explained
to you. If I hadn&#8217;t done that the man would
not have been hurt.&#8221; She gave a woeful little sigh.
&#8220;I helped to take him to the hospital and so I feel acquainted
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shrewd, calculating look swept over Obadiah&#8217;s
face. &#8220;That&#8217;s a most informal introduction, I am
thinking. However, it will do no harm to get on
friendly terms with that fellow. I suppose that it
will mean a suit, anyway, but I won&#8217;t oppose your
going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s face lighted with happiness and pride.
&#8220;Daddy dear, you have the kindest and most thoughtful
heart. You are always trying to do something
nice,&#8221; she laughed, softly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made a mistake
this time, and you will have to think of something else.
The man in the hospital doesn&#8217;t need clothes. I noticed
that his were not hurt in the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Clothes</i>,&#8221; cried Obadiah, much perplexed by the
tribute to himself and the subsequent explanation.
&#8220;Who said anything about clothes?&#8221; Suddenly, understanding
came to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll swear&#8211;&#8221; promised
the astounded manufacturer.</p>

<p>Virginia quickly kissed him squarely upon the
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, her eyes tender with love
and pride, &#8220;you are much too good and generous and
noble to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant, Obadiah appeared about to contradict
his daughter, but, changing his mind, he hurried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
out to his waiting car and pressed the button on the
horn.</p>

<p>At the signal, Ike appeared, coming hurriedly from
the kitchen. As he advanced, he deposited in his
mouth the remains of a slice of pie. Because of the
unfortunate events of the morning, the procurement
of this pastry partook of the nature of a diplomatic
triumph. Ike had but little pride in this. His mind
was upon weightier matters. As he approached his
employer, he bolted the remnants in a manner conducive
neither to his present dignity nor future health.</p>

<p>Obadiah endeavored to fix the shifting glance of his
chauffeur with a piercing eye. &#8220;Ike,&#8221; he demanded,
roughly, &#8220;how did that accident occur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r, dat man come er speedin&#8217; down Secon&#8217; Street
an&#8217; ran smack bang into dis yere caah. He dent it
wid his haid,&#8221; the chauffeur testified glibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me the dent!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike promptly indicated a slight depression in the
body of the car above a rear fender.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did that when you ran into a coal truck and
smashed the fender.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike was greatly astonished but admitted erroneous
conclusions. &#8220;Ah mek er mistake. Dat man mus&#8217;
er landed on de wheel den.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make any more mistakes about this accident,&#8221;
the manufacturer rapped. &#8220;Virginia tells me
that you were coming out Forest Avenue and that this
fellow was going down Second Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike considered this with care, that deception be eliminated.
&#8220;Yas&#8217;r, Miss Virginny ain&#8217; mek no mistake,
neither.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>Obadiah glared at his humble retainer. &#8220;He was
on your right hand then?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah dis&#8217;remembers jes whar dat man cum f&#8217;om,
Misto Dale. He cum so fas&#8217; it plum slip ma mind.&#8221;
Ike scratched his head thoughtfully. &#8220;It done gone
f&#8217;om me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was going down Second Street towards the
Court House and you were coming out home, weren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r, dat&#8217;s jes de way o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, he approached you on your right hand. He
had the right of way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misto Dale, dat man done took all de way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know he had the right of way under the
law,&#8221; bawled Obadiah, provoked by the stupidity of
his servitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r, dat&#8217;s de law.&#8221; A most flattering note of
admiration for his employer&#8217;s legal acumen crept into
Ike&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Misto Dale, yo&#8217;all sutinly knows de
law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind what I know,&#8221; roared Obadiah, thrusting
compliments rudely aside. &#8220;If that fellow hit my
car you must have been in his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sar, Ah was er gwine to hit &#8217;im, &#8217;ceptin&#8217; he
dodge. He done cum so quick ah ain&#8217; seen &#8217;im &#8217;till
he whar der. Yas&#8217;r.&#8221;</p>

<p>Puzzled at what he had unearthed, Obadiah sought
illumination along other lines. &#8220;How fast was that
fellow running, Ike, when he hit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chauffeur lifted his eyes heavenward as if seeking
inspiration. A crow winged its way slowly across
the sky. He followed it critically as if using its speed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
as a measure for the estimate sought. &#8220;&#8217;Bout seventy
seven mile er hour,&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>Obadiah boiled. &#8220;Seventy seven miles an hour on
Second Street is absurd,&#8221; he blurted. &#8220;It&#8217;s too rough.
A man would have to fly to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r dat&#8217;s hit. He was er flyin&#8217;. Jest er hittin&#8217;
de high places.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah scorched his menial with a look which
should have reduced him to a cinder.</p>

<p>Ike shifted uneasily under the unkind gaze of his
indignant employer as he waited further interrogation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How fast were you running?&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s tone
was as warm as his aspect.</p>

<p>Ike deemed it advisable at this point to make his
statements general. &#8220;Ah drives cafful. Safety furst,
dat&#8217;s ma motta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that nonsense of yours before. What
I want to know,&#8221; Obadiah bleated in a high falsetto,
&#8220;is, how fast were you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, Ike turned to the skies. Suddenly came a
change. His doubtful demeanor disappeared. He
met the stern countenance of his employer with a glad
smile of confidence and assurance. To him, in the
hour of need, had been vouchsafed a solution of his
problem. &#8220;Miss Sereny,&#8221; he explained, with great
satisfaction, &#8220;she done tell me not to drive no fas&#8217;er
den er hoss an&#8217; ker&#8217;idge kin go. Dat&#8217;s jes how fas&#8217; ah
goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah leaped into his car and slammed the door.
&#8220;Take me to my office,&#8221; he blazed.</p>

<p>Ike obeyed him, running, it may be noted, at a speed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
well above that usually attained by the horses and carriages
of Serena&#8217;s fond remembrance.</p>

<p>Obadiah entered his office yet much irritated by the
recent examination of his chauffeur. &#8220;Jones,&#8221; he
shouted peevishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service, Sir,&#8221; responded the ever courteous
private secretary, ceasing his social plannings for
the House of Dale, hurriedly, and leaving the bookkeeper
sorely embarrassed in his labors, through the
loss of the voucher from which he was working
snatched away by Mr. Jones, and borne into the manufacturer&#8217;s
presence, as proof that his absence was due
to zealous watchfulness of his employer&#8217;s interests,
rather than to personal motives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Mr. Wilkins that I want to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately, sir.&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s voice demanded
speed and Mr. Jones sped, bearing the bookkeeper&#8217;s
work away with him.</p>

<p>In a moment the expeditious private secretary returned
followed by Hezekiah Wilkins who passed on
into Obadiah&#8217;s room and closed the door.</p>

<p>Obadiah was waiting behind a large desk in the center,
and motioning to his legal adviser to be seated,
made known his business in these words. &#8220;An embarrassing
personal matter has occurred, Hezekiah, in
which I must ask your assistance.&#8221; The manufacturer
chose his words with care. Diplomacy is necessary
when asking corporation lawyers to attend to the
minor concerns of life. &#8220;It is so small a matter, I
hesitate to ask your advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkins was short and fat. His head was bald
and his face intellectual. There was a glint of humor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
in his eyes which was very noticeable when he removed
his nose glasses for purposes of gesticulation. His defective
sight did not prevent him from casting a keen
glance at his employer, meanwhile tapping upon his
front teeth with the gold frame of his glasses. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
hesitate on my account, Obadiah.&#8221; There was a
shadow of a smile on the attorney&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done
everything for you, but&#8211;&#8221; he intended to suggest as
a pleasantry&#8211;&#8220;bail you out of jail,&#8221; but after a second&#8217;s
consideration of his employer&#8217;s grim countenance,
he continued, &#8220;buy you a marriage license,&#8221; as
being less likely to affront a sensitive soul.</p>

<p>Now, Obadiah Dale had never given a moment&#8217;s
consideration to a second marriage, and the thought
that his attorney harbored inner suspicions of matrimonial
designs upon his part interfered with the thread
of his remarks. &#8220;What put that into your head?&#8221;
he demanded, testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put what?&#8221; The fat face of the lawyer reflected
great innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage licenses,&#8221; retorted Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; chuckled the attorney, and quite frankly for
one of his profession, he confessed, &#8220;It just slipped
out, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mill owner gave Hezekiah a severe glance as if
to warn him of the grave danger of slips of the tongue
to one in his profession.</p>

<p>This attention was lost, because the lawyer seemed
greatly interested in the erection of a sign over the
way.</p>

<p>Finding looks unavailing, Obadiah reverted to his
business. &#8220;A fellow on a motorcycle ran into my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
car this morning. He broke a leg and they took him
to the hospital where he is now, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was to blame?&#8221; asked the attorney.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; Obadiah replied crossly, as he remembered
Ike&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get a thing out of
that fool chauffeur of mine. His story is absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were there witnesses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One, I think, besides my daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she say?&#8221; Hezekiah tickled his chin
with his glasses and examined the picture moulding as
if it were something unique in that line.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not asked her, directly. I thought it inadvisable.
I gather that she believes herself to blame because
she told the chauffeur to hurry home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem,&#8221; said the lawyer, resuming his dental tattoo
with great spirit. &#8220;Who had the right of way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The motorcycle was approaching from the right,&#8221;
admitted Obadiah grudgingly.</p>

<p>Hezekiah arose to his feet and moved around until
he stood opposite to his employer. &#8220;Keep out of
court, Obadiah,&#8221; he warned him. &#8220;A jury will soak
you in this kind of case. How far can I go in a compromise?&#8221;
he concluded, perfunctorily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t pay a cent,&#8221; roared Obadiah, flying into a
rage. &#8220;They can&#8217;t bleed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah understood the manufacturer&#8217;s mood. He
paused for a minute and then continued very calmly.
&#8220;How about a couple of hundred dollars and hospital
expenses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow&#8217;s hospital expenses?&#8221; There was a
persuasive note in the lawyer&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>&#8220;No!&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s face was flushed and set in its
obstinacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man may be poor. He may have dependents
who will be deprived of the actual necessities of life.
It could easily be that suffering and want would arise
from this little case.&#8221; There was a pleading note in
Hezekiah&#8217;s voice and almost a look of entreaty upon
his kindly face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give a hang,&#8221; snarled Obadiah. &#8220;That&#8217;s
their bad luck, not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, the attorney waited, silently watching the angry
manufacturer thrust papers from side to side of his
desk.</p>

<p>Finally he glanced up. His temper had worn itself
out. &#8220;Fix it up for twenty-five dollars,&#8221; he snapped.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah shrugged his shoulders in frank disgust at
the smallness of the sum named, nodded his head in
recognition of his instructions and left the room.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>JOE PROVES INTERESTING</span></h2>

<p>The morning was beautiful. During the hours of
darkness a shower had cleansed the great outdoor world
with its gentle moisture. Now, in all of its new laundered
freshness, the earth welcomed the warm rays
of the rising sun, sweeping with millions of scintillating
reflections through the air, clear and pellucid in its
purity. The rays sparkled and glittered on the drops
of moisture which clung to the grass blades and to the
leaves. They gave warm caresses to the bushes and
to the trees and from the upturned faces of the flowers,
waving coyly and coquettishly, they stole sly kisses,
until the blossoms blushed red and pink and hid their
faces beneath the leaves for very shame.</p>

<p>Down from the hills danced a gentle breeze, and,
catching the naughty lovemakers, laughed merrily and
rushed away to whisper the story in the branches of the
trees. The birds overheard it and they laughed, too,
and spread the news, the naughty gossips, in a cheery
chorus of song.</p>

<p>Then the world awakened and heard the laughter
of the wind and the merry song of the birds and felt
the caress of the sun and wise men threw back their
shoulders and took deep draughts of the morning air
and were happy, too.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>At the hospital, a nurse in her garb of white was
humming softly as she moved about among the awakening
patients, setting the ward in order. She stopped
by a bed to remove a glass from the enameled table.</p>

<p>A big, handsome fellow, arrayed in pink pajamas,
opened a pair of black eyes beneath a mop of disheveled
black hair and smiled up at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; she greeted him. &#8220;How are you
this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good&#8211;ouch!&#8221; An attempt to move was the
cause of the peculiar response.</p>

<p>She came to his assistance. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. I forgot about yesterday&#8217;s troubles
while I slept. How could I get so many sore
spots when I only struck in one place?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The nurse laughed as she inspected his chart.
&#8220;How&#8217;s your head this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister&#8211;&#8221; he grinned good humoredly&#8211;&#8220;that
dome of mine has completely recovered. I am healing
from the top down.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised a shade and a ray of sunshine flashed
across the foot of his bed. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that better? It&#8217;s a
beautiful day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rolled and twisted his eyes until he was able to
get a glimpse of a bit of blue sky through the window.
His face registered great regret. &#8220;What a day for
a two or three hundred mile spin, sister,&#8221; he mused.</p>

<p>Again she examined his chart. &#8220;Say, Mr. Joseph
Tolliver Curtis,&#8221; she remonstrated sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who love me call me Joe,&#8221; he interrupted
in a gentle voice as he watched with great interest and
amusement the snap in her hazel eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>She disregarded the brazen hint and proceeded to
reprimand. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to cut out this &#8216;sister&#8217;
business. I might stand for it once in awhile but you
have a chronic case of it. You took a spin yesterday
which is going to make us intimate acquaintances for
some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh death, where is thy sting?&#8221; he interjected.</p>

<p>Perfectly oblivious to his remark, she continued,
&#8220;It will be better, particularly for you, if our acquaintance
is a pleasant one. You will call me&#8211;Miss
Knight&#8211;Mr. Curtis,&#8221; she intimated with a grave dignity
which the wayward blonde curls beneath her cap
did not loyally support.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Night, sable goddess, from ebon throne descends,&#8217;&#8221;
he quoted with dramatic emphasis. &#8220;Do
you furnish breakfast as well as lectures on behavior
in this hospital?&#8221;</p>

<p>She retired with great hauteur between smiling masculine
eyes to the end of the ward. Suddenly, she
whirled and waved her hand at the injured one, and, as
if addressing an old and intimate friend, called, &#8220;You
can have your breakfast in a minute, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his apartment above the garage at the Dale home,
Ike was awakened by the shrill alarm of an electric
bell rung from a button pressed by Serena in the comfort
of her own bed. Thus he arose betimes of necessity,
rather than from personal desire to salute the
rising sun.</p>

<p>Breathing deeply, the spirit of the morning entered
into the chauffeur&#8217;s veins as he watched a couple of fat
robins enjoying a breakfast of elastic worms pulled
from the moist earth. Lifting his voice in muffled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
song, he ran the big car out of the garage, and, opening
its bonnet, reclined on the radiator and lazily looked at
the engine.</p>

<p>Like a high priestess veiled in clouds of incense while
engaged in holy mysteries, Serena moved about her
kitchen in the midst of appetizing odors, preparing
coffee, frying ham and cooking waffles for the morning
refreshment of the Dales. Now, as if such dainties
were insufficient, she brought forth another skillet and
put diverse parts of a fowl therein, and with skilled,
fork-armed hand shifted them about until they sissled
and hissed and fried.</p>

<p>The morning breeze faintly wafted pleasing odors
to Ike. They assailed his nostrils delightfully. He
breathed yet a little deeper and sang yet a little louder.
Closing the bonnet, he climbed into a seat that he might,
in pleasant anticipation, rest from labor. Suddenly,
there came to him a more delicious scent. He sniffed
in disbelief that fate could be so kind, but his experienced
olfactory nerves reassured him. In such matters,
they could not err.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicken!&#8221; He sniffed and sought appropriate
outlet for joy. With a roar which shook the early
peace of the neighborhood as a salute of artillery, Ike
raced the engine of the machine and in the midst of this
diabolical furore, he sang a paean of joy.</p>

<p>The uproar smote the calm of Serena&#8217;s kitchen. She
jerked with alarm, but the wisdom of years asserted
itself. Rushing out on the stoop she fixed indignant
eyes on the chauffeur. &#8220;You, Ike,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;stop
dat noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned her words with a cheery smile of trust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
and confidence. Deafened by his own row, he judged
that she desired speech with him. The engine slowed
and the noise decreased until there could be distinguished
the words of a ballad of strenuous love,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Ah kissed &#8217;er in de mouf</p>
<p>An&#8217; ah hugged &#8217;er in de souf.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217; you know bettah an&#8217; to mek a noise dat a
way, dis time in de mo&#8217;ning?&#8221; the irritated cook inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217; mek no noise, Miss Sereny. Hit de
<i>caah</i>,&#8221; he made reply in pleasant tones. It would be
folly to irritate unduly the custodian of the chicken
lest the fowl be consumed before friendly relations
could be reestablished. His black face was bathed in
good humor as he went on. &#8220;Miss Sereny, ma hand
an&#8217; ma foot done slip.&#8221;</p>

<p>That smile disarmed the cook. It was his strongest
weapon, but Ike usually resorted to a sullen obstinacy
which infuriated her, to his undoing. She glared at
him for a moment and then his smile and the spirit of
the morning claimed her. &#8220;You bettah watch you&#8217;
step, den,&#8221; she returned, and their voices blended in a
boisterous gust of laughter.</p>

<p>Ike&#8217;s salute to his favorite fowl awakened Virginia
from her sleep with a start. Sitting up in bed, she cast
a frightened glance about her pretty bedroom. For a
moment she listened intently, drawn up in a little white
heap on her bed, her blue eyes misty with dreams,
peeping out from a frame of towsled hair. &#8220;It&#8217;s Ike
running the engine,&#8221; she decided.</p>

<p>She gave a little yawn as she poked her feet into her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
slippers and ran over to a window. From it she could
look, between the tops of two great elms, across the
valley in which South Ridgefield lay to the top of a
small hill upon which, bathed in the morning sun, stood
the brick hospital building. Her eyes rested upon
it, thoughtfully, and she took a deep breath of morning
air. She began to sing happily as she turned to
dress.</p>

<p>Obadiah was shaving in his bath room. He used an
old fashioned razor, the pride of his youth. His deep
cut wrinkles made it a matter of care&#8211;almost a ceremony.
Ike&#8217;s disturbance nearly resulted in the amputation
of a lip. Obadiah was peeved. Rushing to the
window, he threw it open. He heard Serena&#8217;s words
of remonstrance and determined to dismiss Ike. He
often did that.</p>

<p>Suddenly the morning breeze played caressingly
about him. He pulled his bath robe closer to him and
slammed the window down. His face felt stiff where
the lather had dried upon it. &#8220;Darn the luck,&#8221;
growled Obadiah. He washed his face, restropped his
razor, reprepared his lather, and finally completed his
shave by nicking his neck on his Adam&#8217;s apple.
&#8220;Dang it all,&#8221; he howled. The world was ill using
Obadiah and he resented it. He dressed slowly and
from his bedroom window moodily viewed his beautiful
grounds.</p>

<p>Into his view danced Virginia, swinging a wide
brimmed hat by its streamers and singing gaily as she
made for a bed of sweet peas.</p>

<p>Obadiah watched her, but the harsh lines upon his
face did not soften nor the irascible look fade. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
gave a grim nod when the girl discovered him and
shouted a merry greeting.</p>

<p>There was no one in the dining room when the manufacturer
entered it that morning. He seated himself
and began to eat his melon.</p>

<p>The rich voice of Serena with all of its carrying
power came in at the window, &#8220;Yo&#8217; all bettah git in
yere mighty fas&#8217;. You&#8217; Daddy done eat up all de
breakfus&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then sounded the answering words of the girl, ringing
silvery and sweet, &#8220;Ask Daddy to wait. I have
some beautiful flowers for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Serena was suddenly beset with internal mutterings
and grumblings and broke into incoherent utterances.
&#8220;Ah ain&#8217; got no time&#8211;no time&#8211;flowers&#8211;tell him
dat&#8211;No siree&#8211;Ah ain&#8217; no fool.&#8221; A few moments
later she entered the dining room worrying aloud.
&#8220;Dat chil&#8217; gwine be fo&#8217;ced to eat a col&#8217; breakfus. Ah
caint keep grub hot all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must learn to be on time at her meals,&#8221; Obadiah
scolded.</p>

<p>Serena gave him a look of stern disapprobation.
&#8220;Dat gal miss &#8217;er breakfus er gittin&#8217; flowers fo&#8217; yo&#8217;
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Light feet ran through the hall and Virginia skipped
into the room, her face flushed, her hair tossed and a
bunch of sweet peas in either hand.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, two soft arms were about Obadiah&#8217;s
neck. He found his face buried in a mass of blossoms
while girlish laughter in peals of delight rang in his
ears.</p>

<p>Virginia shifted her position to examine in mock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
solemnity the sober face of her father blinking from
the mass of delicate colors. She gave a shout of
amusement. &#8220;Daddy, you don&#8217;t match very well.&#8221;
She shifted the bouquets about his face. &#8220;There, that
is much better,&#8221; she decided. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so,
Serena?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah sneezed.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you,&#8221; Virginia whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take those things out of my nose,&#8221; protested Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look so beautiful,&#8221; the girl giggled. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t
he, Serena?&#8221;</p>

<p>The colored woman watched the proceedings with
great gravity. &#8220;Leave you&#8217; Daddy &#8217;lone, chil&#8217;,&#8221; she
urged. &#8220;De breakfus gwine be ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah released himself from his daughter&#8217;s embrace
and the blossoms dropped in a glowing mass upon
the table. &#8220;Eat your breakfast and stop this foolishness,&#8221;
he told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll eat anything you&#8217;ll give me, Daddy dear. I
am as hungry as a bear.&#8221; She glanced at the clock.
&#8220;It&#8217;s late. I must hurry to get over to the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; he asked in apparent surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;To see the man who was hurt yesterday. I spoke
to you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but upon reflection I think it inadvisable.
You might catch some disease in a place like that. You
must think of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of disappointment came into her face. She
ate in silence, the gayety of the morning swept away
by his refusal.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, she followed him into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
living room where he sank into a chair and devoted
himself to his paper. Thinking deeply, she paused by
the center table. Very quietly, she opened a drawer
and took from it the book which had belonged to her
mother. She caressed the little volume gently for a
moment, a great tenderness in her eyes. Then she replaced
it. Determination had driven disappointment
from her face and there was a faint reflection of his
obstinacy in her jaw when she went over and confronted
her father. &#8220;Daddy,&#8221; she commenced, very
softly. &#8220;All your life you have been helping people&#8211;thinking
of others. In your thoughtfulness for my
health you wish to keep me away from the hospital.
But, don&#8217;t you see, I was to blame for that accident.
It is my duty to help that man, if I can. I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah glanced over his paper at Virginia as she
began to speak. Realizing that her words savored of
rank rebellion, he reddened and glared at the sheet before
him as if it contained a warning of the presence
in his household of a serpent pledged to destroy its
peace. &#8220;What&#8211;what&#8211;what&#8217;s this?&#8221; he spluttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t allow your love to make a coward of me&#8211;turn
me from my duty, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah blinked as he considered this mutiny.
Judgment and experience warned him to control himself.
Unpleasant differences in the past had not always
resulted as he could have wished. There had
been times when he had been forced not only to sue
Virginia for peace but likewise to make abject overtures
to that firmest of allies, Serena.</p>

<p>Obadiah thought rapidly. Outside of moral suasion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
modern opinion recognizes but few methods for the
influencing of eighteen year old female insurgents.
If Obadiah argued, he would get mad. In his dilemma,
he surrendered, but not with good grace.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he yielded sulkily, &#8220;if you feel that way about
it, have it your own way.&#8221; Scowling darkly, he flung
his paper from him and departed for his office with
asperity.</p>

<p>From the porch Virginia waved him a last good bye.
&#8220;Poor Daddy. He is so afraid that I will get sick,&#8221;
she thought, pensively, as she watched the disappearing
car. But in a moment her good spirits returned
and she hurried into the kitchen. Serena was forced
to lay aside her work until the chicken was daintily arranged
in a basket with other delicacies added by the
old negress in reparation, possibly, for her weakness in
yielding to Ike a small portion of the invalid&#8217;s fare.</p>

<p>Later that morning Virginia arrived at the hospital.
Following the directions given her, she found herself
standing in the doorway of a long room on the second
floor. On each side of a center aisle ran a row of white
bedsteads. The walls, painted a dull buff, were pierced
by many windows and the linoleum in the aisle and the
hard wood floor were waxed and polished until they
shone. In this place, cleanliness, fresh air, and sunshine
reigned.</p>

<p>The beds were filled with pajama clad men. To the
embarrassed young girl it was as if she had blundered
into a man&#8217;s bedroom, and impulsively she turned to
flee.</p>

<p>A cheery voice arrested her, and the nurse whom
she had met in the reception room on the previous day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
greeted her. &#8220;I told you that I would meet you here.&#8221;
She smiled with a frank cordiality which instantly dissipated
the visitor&#8217;s embarrassment.</p>

<p>Virginia knew now that she liked this young woman,
even though she was a great tease, so she answered the
smile with one of equal friendliness and told her, &#8220;It
is nice to find someone I know&#8221;; but instantly she referred
to the cause for her visit. &#8220;How is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that we have his fever under control,&#8221;
laughed the nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now she is beginning to tease,&#8221; thought Virginia.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t notice it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse went on. &#8220;He is really getting along
fine. If I were you I shouldn&#8217;t give a moment&#8217;s worry
to that young man&#8217;s health. Don&#8217;t trouble to plan
your remarks to him, either. He won&#8217;t listen to them.
He does most of the talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The walk down the aisle between those beds, each
with its pair of masculine optics, was a trial for the
girl. It seemed miles. At last, safely by this gauntlet
of inquisitive male glances, she found herself looking
down into those same black eyes which had looked
into hers for a second out on Forest Avenue. Then
they were dazed with pain, now they were filled with
friendly inquiry.</p>

<p>The nurse, Miss Knight, was direct and explicit.
&#8220;Joe,&#8221; she announced, &#8220;this is the young lady who
says that she put you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe accepted this surprising remark as a matter of
amusement which increased as the nurse went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now she comes to soften the hard blows with tender
words and kind attentions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>Virginia blushed furiously. She thought Miss
Knight&#8217;s manner towards men distinctly common.</p>

<p>A deep voice came from the bed. &#8220;I am very glad
to meet you and be able to thank you for what I have
been told you did for me, Miss Dale. That accident
was my hard luck.&#8221; He put his whole soul into his
smile of welcome and the girl knew that she liked it.</p>

<p>Having endeavored to relieve his guest&#8217;s embarrassment,
he turned upon Miss Knight, the greatly delighted
cause of it, and adapted his manner and speech
to her case. &#8220;Say, sister, blow. Blow while the
breeze will toss you away. I haven&#8217;t noticed any invitations
for you to sit in on this peace conference.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse flared at his words, although his smile
had tempered them. Drawing herself up, she made
answer with great dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to urge me not to hang around
while your wounds are being dressed with soothing lotions.
It&#8217;s not necessary to hit me with an automobile
to get me out of the way,&#8221; she exclaimed with
great sarcasm, and flounced away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gloom of night departs,&#8221; he chuckled, and,
turning dancing eyes upon his visitor, continued softly,
&#8220;and now comes dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia flushed again. &#8220;For all that you know,
it may be stormy,&#8221; she retorted, astonished at her own
glib tongue. The merry banter of the patient and
nurse had surprised her. She had been taught that
this sort of thing was vulgar. Yet, somehow, it didn&#8217;t
seem so dreadful. She suspected that she rather liked
it and was troubled by this symptom of innate depravity.
Now she became aware that those black eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
studying her, and mischief gleamed in their depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our meeting was very sudden yesterday,&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a chance to give you my card.
My name is Joseph Tolliver Curtis. Those who&#8211;&#8221;
he hesitated and then went on&#8211;&#8220;are my friends, call
me Joe.&#8221; Happiness radiated from him. He was so
good humored that it was contagious.</p>

<p>The visitor beamed upon the patient. &#8220;My name
is Virginia Dale,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he admitted, and then, with the manner
of intense personal interest, he demanded, &#8220;Do
your friends&#8211;your intimate friends&#8211;by any chance
call you &#8216;Virge&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s eyes flashed as she
retorted, &#8220;They would hear from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By letter,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;or telephone?&#8221; In a
moment he continued, &#8220;I have it. You will sing to
them just as you are going to sing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you are going to sing to me. Every
one who visits a hospital should sing. It was found
wonderfully soothing to the patients in the big army
hospitals during the war. After they had listened to
the performers they were more contented to endure
their suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They would have died on the spot if I&#8217;d sung,&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p>They both laughed in the exuberance of their youth
at their own nonsense until his injured ribs stopped
him and she became very serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came, today&#8211;&#8221; her manner was almost shy&#8211;&#8220;to
tell you how sorry I am for that accident. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
makes me unhappy to think of you suffering here
through my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you blame yourself? You had nothing
at all to do with it,&#8221; he declared with great earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told our chauffeur to hurry,&#8221; she explained, and
then with finality, &#8220;if he hadn&#8217;t, there would have
been no collision.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again his injured ribs subdued his laughter. &#8220;If
everybody had stayed off the street, I wouldn&#8217;t have
been hurt. That&#8217;s your argument.&#8221; He studied her
face for a moment and then resumed. &#8220;Listen, I
am going to tell you a secret. Promise never to
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest,&#8221; she agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was running away over the speed limit. I must
have been going forty miles an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia became the custodian of his secret with
great calmness and solemnly confessed, &#8220;We were
running over the speed limit, too. Ike usually does.
He knows that I enjoy going fast. The speed limit
in this town is away too low, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he concurred, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have been hurt
worse if I had been running twice as fast. The point
is, that we could both be arrested and fined for speeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They always arrest Ike,&#8221; she explained with complacency.
&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t care a bit. He&#8217;s used to it.&#8221;
Anxiety arose in her eyes. &#8220;Surely, they wouldn&#8217;t
arrest one as badly hurt as you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know that judge.&#8221; Joe spoke with experience.
&#8220;If they brought a dying man into his court
who had only fifty dollars to leave to his widow and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
children, that judge would take it from him for speeding.
That is, if he rode a motorcycle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the injustice of it. Doesn&#8217;t he care for motorcyclists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; asserted Joe with great forcefulness. &#8220;Nobody
likes a motorcyclist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; proclaimed Virginia, and then, after taking
a moment to recover from the embarrassment of her
own outspokenness, she continued, &#8220;It&#8217;s not right.
They are entitled to equal justice,&#8221; as if enunciating a
newly discovered truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, they are entitled to it, but they don&#8217;t get it.
That&#8217;s why I must keep quiet. My accident insurance
will take care of my hospital bills and my job will
keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you collect damages?&#8221; urged Virginia
with great gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s consideration, she solved the legal
problem. &#8220;From me&#8211;that is, from my father, for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the reference to her father a change came in the
injured man. His good humor faded. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said
decidedly. &#8220;In the first place I wouldn&#8217;t accept money
from your father and in the second place he would not
give any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know my father,&#8221; she said with pride.
&#8220;He is a very just man. Sometimes he&#8217;s gruff and a
little cross but he doesn&#8217;t mean anything by that. He
always wants to do the right and generous thing.&#8221;
Her face was alight with loyalty and admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he?&#8221; There was a note of sarcasm in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
voice which disappeared, and he said no more after he
had read her eyes.</p>

<p>She misinterpreted the change in him. &#8220;I have
stayed too long,&#8221; she worried. &#8220;You are tired.&#8221; She
remembered the chicken. &#8220;I brought you something.&#8221;
She put the plate of fowl beside him.</p>

<p>He viewed it in joyous anticipation. &#8220;Fine,&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;If there is one thing I love, it is fried
chicken. How did you guess it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at Miss Knight who had joined them.
&#8220;A bird told me,&#8221; she answered him.</p>

<p>The nurse put her hands on her hips and viewed the
visitor with marked suspicion at this remark, but, as if
satisfied that her distrust was unfounded, she retired to
the diet kitchen from which hearty laughter immediately
thereafter resounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good bye,&#8221; she told him almost shyly.</p>

<p>His good spirits had returned. &#8220;You and I are
friends, and remember, we are always going to be
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and said again, &#8220;Good bye, Mr. Curtis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends call me Joe,&#8221; he reminded her.</p>

<p>Virginia hesitated, and then, &#8220;Good bye&#8211;Joe,&#8221; she
whispered and left the ward with a sweet little smile.</p>

<p>In the hall Miss Knight rejoined her. &#8220;Before you
go I want to show you something which is our pride
and joy at the present moment,&#8221; she explained to the
girl. She opened a door and displayed a beautifully
furnished room which glistened in its cleanliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very attractive, but why is the room different?&#8221;
asked Virginia.</p>

<p>The nurse pointed to a bronze tablet. It bore the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
name of the donor, one well known in South Ridgefield.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beautiful idea,&#8221; the girl exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; responded the nurse. &#8220;The gift includes
not only the furniture but the endowment of
the bed for five years.&#8221; She laughed. &#8220;The man
who gave it is ahead of the game. He was hurt in a
railroad accident and was here for a couple of months.
He sued the railroad company and collected more than
enough from them to do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards, by Virginia&#8217;s express wish, she was
taken to the nursery and permitted to hold a recently
arrived guest in her arms, who happened at the moment
to be awake. She was allowed to peek into the maternity
ward with its beds filled with women, and her
tour ended in the dispensary where she met Dr. Jackson
and a nurse who were busily engaged in caring for the
ailments of the sick babies the mothers brought in
from outside. At last she left for home, and on the
way she thought of this strange new world she had
been shown in this big brick building, but principally
she thought of a pair of black eyes that laughed and of
the gross injustices to which down trodden motorcyclists
were the victims.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, Miss Knight was very busy
among the shining utensils in the diet kitchen when she
was disturbed by another visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said a voice, &#8220;but could you
direct me to a patient? My name,&#8221; he continued
suavely, &#8220;is Wilkins&#8211;Hezekiah Wilkins.&#8221; He
wiped his bald head, and went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s very warm
today&#8211;extremely so.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s warm,&#8221; agreed Miss Knight, &#8220;and this
electric heater makes it a darn sight warmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah intended to give the nurse a look of sympathetic
understanding, but ended by giving her a
friendly grin. &#8220;I comprehend your point of view,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;A trip to a pleasant resort would be more
agreeable, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knight viewed his words in the sense of a tentative
invitation and considered the merriment in his
eyes suspicious in one of his age. She froze and demanded
with the utmost frigidity, &#8220;Whom do you
wish to see?&#8221;</p>

<p>Utterly innocent that he had all but persuaded this
sophisticated nurse that he was one of those aged
profligates of whom young women had best beware,
Hezekiah drew forth an envelope upon which he had
entered certain notes which he now found difficult to
decipher, and told her.</p>

<p>She led the way and the lawyer followed through the
ranks of curious eyes. He vigorously mopped at his
shining cranium and held his inverted panama before
him as if taking a collection of errant drops of moisture
that they might not mar the polished floor. This
detracted from the dignity of Hezekiah&#8217;s progress.</p>

<p>Seating himself by Joe Curtis&#8217;s bed, the attorney
gazed at the youth for a few moments in polite curiosity.</p>

<p>The motorcyclist returned the look with one of undisguised
distrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Hezekiah Wilkins,&#8221; announced the
lawyer when the mutual scrutiny had continued so long
that it threatened to become embarrassing. &#8220;I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
reasons to believe that I am speaking to Mr. Joseph
Tolliver Curtis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me, Steve,&#8221; responded Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve what?&#8221; inquired Hezekiah, much perplexed.
Light dawned upon him. &#8220;Oh, yes&#8211;quite so&#8211;assuredly,&#8221;
he indulged in a soft chuckle. &#8220;I am dense
at times. Slow might be better, eh?&#8221; Again he
chuckled. &#8220;Slow for the rising generations, particularly&#8211;&#8221;
he smiled genially at Joe&#8211;&#8220;when they ride
motorcycles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe abated none of his vigilance. His policy was
that of watchful waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day is very warm,&#8221; continued Hezekiah, looking
about the ward with interest. &#8220;This is a delightfully
cool and pleasant place. You are to be congratulated
upon having such comfortable quarters in which
to recuperate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; Joe&#8217;s voice was distinctly hostile. &#8220;Are
you the advertising agent for this hospital?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah&#8217;s trained ear sensed unfriendliness abroad.
He changed his manner of approach with the quickness
of a skilled strategist. &#8220;Mr. Curtis,&#8221; he went on
briskly, &#8220;I represent Mr. Obadiah Dale. You have
no doubt heard of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your motorcycle ran into Mr. Dale&#8217;s automobile
yesterday,&#8221; the lawyer resumed. &#8220;I do not come to
seek compensation for the injury to his car. I am delighted,
finding you as I do upon a bed of pain, to be
upon a much pleasanter mission.&#8221; Hezekiah smiled
benignantly. &#8220;There was a witness to the accident.
With some difficulty, I have located him and procured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
his statement. While it may be conceded that this
person has no special skill or training in estimating the
speed of moving vehicles, he is&#8221; (the attorney&#8217;s manner
expressed assurance) &#8220;prepared to testify that
you were operating your machine at a speed in excess
of that permitted by law.&#8221; He paused as if awaiting
an incriminating admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; snapped Joe.</p>

<p>Hezekiah continued with increased emphasis. &#8220;Assuming
this to be true, it appears that you were entirely
or in part responsible for the accident and the consequent
damage to Mr. Dale&#8217;s car and your own person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life,&#8221; cried Joe with great excitement.
&#8220;I have a witness who says the Dale car was
to blame for the accident and that it was exceeding the
speed limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely.&#8221; Mr. Wilkins chuckled. &#8220;There are always
witnesses for both sides. My gracious, if this
were not true how could we have law suits? It&#8217;s the
reputation of a witness for truth and veracity which
counts in court, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Admitting your witness,&#8221; Hezekiah resumed with
great cheerfulness, &#8220;the speed of your own machine is
certain to be the subject of controversy. My client has
no desire to enter into this. He waives it.&#8221; Hezekiah
likewise waved his glasses and then went on speaking
much more rapidly as one hurrying to be rid of a task
in which he has no heart. &#8220;My client not only waives
your personal responsibility and the material damage
suffered by him, but authorizes me, in his behalf, to
tender you this check in the sum of twenty-five dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
to assist in the defrayment of your hospital expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe Curtis&#8217;s eyes flashed with temper. &#8220;Obadiah
Dale and his money can go straight to the devil,&#8221; he
roared, in a voice which startled the entire ward and
made the lawyer jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm yourself, Sir,&#8221; urged Hezekiah. &#8220;Undue
excitement is injudicious in your physical condition.
Bless my soul, there may be grounds for differences
over the sum tendered, but I can see no reason for
intense anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down the aisle came Miss Knight, stern of face.
&#8220;Say,&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;do you think that this is a
livery stable, Joe? If you do, you had better wake
up. That rough stuff doesn&#8217;t go around here. Do
you get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her a most sheepish glance. &#8220;Sister,&#8221; he
began.</p>

<p>The nurse&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;Must I speak to you
again about that &#8216;sister&#8217; habit. I won&#8217;t stand for it.&#8221;
She explained to the lawyer, &#8220;I not only have to nurse
these men but I have to teach them manners, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before her righteous indignation, a great meekness
descended upon Joe. &#8220;I am sorry, Miss Knight. I
didn&#8217;t mean to start a rough house, only I&#8211;got mad.&#8221;
He smiled at her.</p>

<p>She surrendered to his humility and that smile. She
adjusted his pillow and brushed the hair back from his
eyes with her hand. &#8220;You are a bad boy, Joe. I am
going to forgive you for this, but the next time you
start anything, you will be punished.&#8221; She shook a
threatening finger at him. &#8220;Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; he answered in the tone and manner of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
naughty small boy. He rolled his head towards the
lawyer. &#8220;I owe you an apology for losing my temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, my boy,&#8221; said Hezekiah, who had
viewed the calming of the storm with relief. &#8220;A gale
clears the atmosphere. Plain speaking begets clear
understanding.&#8221; Resuming his glasses, the lawyer regarded
the youth with great friendliness, and, after a
moment, deemed it safe to go on. &#8220;You expressed
yourself so&#8211;ah&#8211;&#8221; (he sought for an inoffensive
term) &#8220;with such certainty of feeling that I assume
that you have determined upon some measure of adjustment
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Joe Curtis&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;There can be no
adjustment between Obadiah Dale and me,&#8221; he answered
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Hezekiah&#8217;s regret had the ring of sincerity.
&#8220;In a friendly spirit towards you, my boy,&#8221; he
urged, &#8220;I would advise against the development of an
hostile feeling towards Mr. Dale. He had no more to
do with that accident than the man in the moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; admitted Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The institution of an action at law is an expensive
proceeding. As a lawyer I warn you that the outcome
would be extremely uncertain. Who can tell what a
jury will do?&#8221; Hezekiah shook his head solemnly,
thereby registering his grave doubts of the action of
twelve men good and true.</p>

<p>&#8220;Institute an action,&#8221; repeated Joe, his eyes dancing
with mischief. &#8220;Say, Uncle, when I sue that old
skate, it sure is going to be some case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah waxed indignant. This may have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
due either to Joe&#8217;s intimation of relationship to himself
or to the opprobrious designation of his client as an
old skate. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mislead yourself,&#8221; he exclaimed
peevishly. &#8220;You will be thrown out of court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe ruffled visibly. &#8220;Who is going to throw me
out of court?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Obadiah Dale?&#8221;
Another idea struck him. He gave the lawyer a most
threatening and pugnacious glance. &#8220;Maybe you
think <i>you</i> can do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah&#8217;s amazement at the suspicion that either he
or his client contemplated physical violence upon this
young giant, swathed in bandages, was extreme.
&#8220;Gorry diamonds, you must be crazy,&#8221; he gasped, and
then the other&#8217;s point of view came to him. He burst
into a big booming peal of honest amusement, an infectious
laugh which brought instant peace. &#8220;My
friend,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;you misunderstand me. I attempted
to suggest that in view of the evidence which
I can produce, a court would refuse to consider your
claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with the witness I have,&#8221; Joe insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about this wonderful witness of
yours?&#8221; chuckled Hezekiah, comfortable in the assurance
of holding the master hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My witness&#8221; (the calmness of his voice did not
quite conceal a note of exultation in it) &#8220;is Virginia
Dale.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY</span></h2>

<p>In the Dale home, dinner was served in the middle
of the day on Sunday, and Serena caused the meal to
partake of the nature of a banquet. Abstemious in
week day luncheons, Obadiah succumbed to the flesh
pots on the seventh day and thereafter relapsed into
slumber during digestion even as a boa-constrictor.</p>

<p>He was sleeping off his Sunday engorgement in a
porch chair. His head drooped awkwardly and he had
slumped into his best clothes, while from time to time
he choked and coughed and made weird noises. All
about him lay the peace of a summer Sabbath broken
only by the low hum of the bees gathering sweetness
from the blooming honeysuckle vine near by. Only
the energetic resisted the combined attacks of plenteousness
and the somnolent afternoon.</p>

<p>Virginia had not surrendered to the soporific tendencies
of the hour. She had conversed with her father
until made aware that, mentally speaking, he was no
longer with her. Such knowledge is discouraging even
to the most enthusiastic of female dialogists, and so,
as the minutes passed, her words lost force and her
sentences fire. Compelled to seek other fields of interest,
the girl strolled aimlessly about the lawn until
she came to the gate. The street looked cool and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
inviting beneath its arching elms and she moved down it
slowly. She had almost reached the corner when a
woman&#8217;s voice sounded from an awning shaded porch,
&#8220;Virginia, come here. Don&#8217;t you pass my house without
stopping.&#8221; It was Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Hennie, I&#8217;m coming. I was sure that you
were taking a nap.&#8221; The girl turned up a walk, bordered
with blooming rose bushes, towards an old-fashioned
house. &#8220;You are as busy as usual, I suppose?&#8221;
she continued, after she had been affectionately greeted
by her hostess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson nodded. No other woman in South
Ridgefield gave as much of her time and, proportionately,
of her wealth to help others as did this strangely
constituted widow. Hers was a frank nature, given
to the expression of its views without regard to time
or place. She had the faculty of so phrasing her remarks
that they cut their victim cruelly and convulsed
her hearers. So, respected for her innate goodness,
and feared for her sharp tongue, Mrs. Henderson had
many acquaintances but few friends. She was judged
in the light of a magazine of high explosives, dangerous
to those near, but likely to blow up if left without
attention. Many were her friends because they were
afraid not to be, but there were those who appreciated
her character. Strangely, these were they who had
waged mighty battles with her, to emerge from strife
her devoted adherents. Having felt her sting, they
dubbed her harmless as a dove, delighting in her intimate
companionship. Such a one had been Virginia&#8217;s
mother.</p>

<p>But Obadiah had no place in this category. Soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
after the death of his wife, Mrs. Henderson had discovered
that a girl who worked in his mill was sick and
in dire want. She asked him to assist the sufferer,
but, to her surprise, the mill owner refused. Thereupon,
Mrs. Henderson, without mincing words, expressed
her opinion of him. Also, she repeated her remarks
to a friend.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s legs were thin, and under stress of excitement
he pitched his voice high. When it became
known that Mrs. Henderson had likened the mill owner,
to his face, to a mosquito sucking blood from his employees,
the whole town laughed. The tale spread to
his mill, during a time of labor unrest, and a cartoon
portraying the manufacturer as a mosquito hovering
about emaciated workers was circulated.</p>

<p>A strike followed in which the employees were successful
and Obadiah never forgave Mrs. Henderson
for giving a weapon to his opponents. Yet, strangely
enough, he had never attempted to interfere with her
friendship for his daughter. Possibly, knowing the
widow, he feared that she would openly defy him, and,
abetted by Serena, carry the war into his own house,
to the greater enjoyment of his fellow townsmen.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Henderson welcomed Virginia, she was
thinking of other things than Obadiah. She was filled
with amusement and gave vent to laughter. &#8220;Dearie,
how on earth did you get mixed up with that minstrel
parade? I never dreamed that my little girl would
startle this town.&#8221; Again the widow gave way to
merriment. She was thinking of a group of women
she had caught discussing with great unkindness the
outcome of the girl&#8217;s efforts to make the pickaninnies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
happy. Hennie&#8217;s championship of her favorite had
been unusually vigorous, and the endeavors of the
critics to reverse themselves had resembled a stampede.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had nothing to do with the parade,&#8221; Virginia
told her. &#8220;We followed it so that the orphans might
enjoy the music. As we had nearly frightened them
out of their wits, I took them for a ride to make up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard how you came to take the orphans for a
ride. I could understand that, but the minstrel part
puzzled me,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s amusement faded into
seriousness. &#8220;That ride idea is a splendid one. It
would add so much to the happiness of those children.&#8221;
She continued, &#8220;I have been on the Board of
that Home for years. There are so many things to
be done over there and so little to do with. No one is
particularly interested in the place. We must find
some way, though, to arrange rides for those orphans
now that you have started things going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was instantly fired with great enthusiasm.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them out each week, myself,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson smiled. &#8220;We can&#8217;t allow you to
continue to excite too much interest in this town.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl disregarded the objection. &#8220;But I started
it, Hennie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very true, but you can&#8217;t expect your father
to let you use his fine car for those children. Anyway,
it is not necessary to bother about that, because it
is entirely too small. We need a truck. Something in
which movable seats can be placed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like those at the mill? Why not ask Daddy for
one of them?&#8221; suggested Virginia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;They would be the very thing,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
admitted, but she shook her head hopelessly. &#8220;Your
father would never let you have one of them. We
must look elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he will, Hennie,&#8221; Virginia assured her
with great confidence. The widow&#8217;s doubting eye
moved the girl to remonstrate, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know him
at all. I think that it is the strangest thing, that you
have been my father&#8217;s neighbor all of these years and
don&#8217;t understand him better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson displayed sudden stern-eyed interest
in a flower bed upon her lawn, and the toe of her
shoe softly tapped the floor of the porch.</p>

<p>The girl leaned towards the older woman, her face
aglow with pride and admiration, as she searched for
some acknowledgment of her words. &#8220;Daddy is so
noble and so good,&#8221; she explained in a voice modulated
by tenderness. &#8220;He spends all of his time thinking
about other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lines of Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s mouth relaxed, and
the tempo of the tapping toe slowed. Her eyes twinkled
merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it wonderful, Hennie?&#8221; and Virginia looked
up to a face for a moment puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very wonderful, child,&#8221; responded the widow, and
Virginia never dreamed that there was a delicate note
of sarcasm in the voice. Leaning forward, Mrs. Henderson
clasped the girl&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Your father is a
lucky man to have such love and affection,&#8221; she said,
and then as though thinking aloud, she murmured,
&#8220;I hope that he appreciates it.&#8221; After a pause she
returned to the subject of the orphans with great vigor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
&#8220;Some one in this town must loan us a truck. That
is all there is about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Daddy do it. He will love to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hopeful enthusiasm of the girl was lost upon the
older woman. &#8220;Well, it will do no harm to give him
the opportunity,&#8221; she conceded dryly; &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t
count on it too much if I were you.&#8221; Suddenly, she
remembered something. &#8220;Dear me, I almost forgot
it. I must run over to the Lucinda Home a minute.
You come along, dear,&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hennie, I can&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t a hat. I am not
dressed to go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson smiled. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difference
what you wear over there. Most of the old
ladies are so nearly blind that they can&#8217;t tell what you
have on.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Virginia agreed to go, and, as the distance to the
institution was short, in a few minutes they entered
the grounds.</p>

<p>The Lucinda Home for Aged Women occupied a
large brick building. A triple-decked porch, supported
by posts and brackets of ornamental iron work
covered the entire front of the edifice and afforded delightful
resting places from which to view the beautiful
grounds.</p>

<p>The two women ascended the steps to the lower
porch. On either side of the entrance stretched a line
of chairs occupied by old ladies. They rocked and
fanned and stared across the grounds with dulled, unseeing
eyes, as if watching and waiting for something.</p>

<p>The afternoon light flashed against the spectacles.
It brought out the snow of the moving heads. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
showed the deep carved lines of age and it disclosed
the hands, knotted and toil worn.</p>

<p>Once these faces were soft and full; these eyes
snapped with health and joy. Love showered its
kisses. The world showed wondrously beautiful in
the tender light of romance and the voice of hope rang
clear and strong. Came babies for these hands to
fondle and caress, and tiny forms to be upheld as little
feet struggled in first steps upon the rough and hilly
path. Noble deeds of unselfishness gleamed in the
shadowed lives of these women as they battled with the
adversities which all who live must face. Slowly their
beauty faded; their eyes no longer sparkled; their
hands were red and hard. Little ones grew into men
and women and went away, filled with hope and proud
in their strength, leaving loneliness behind. Through
the years, a shadow, almost indiscernible to youthful
eyes, drew ever closer. One by one, they had seen
friends and loved ones pass behind the black veil, until
they were alone in a world, cold, loveless, without hope,
waiting<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>Waiting. Yes, waiting&#8211;slowly rocking and fanning&#8211;living
anew the past, and peering out into the
sunshine as if they sought with their poor eyes to
glimpse the approach of that enfolding shadow of mystery.</p>

<p>The visitors paused for a moment at the entrance,
sobered by the tragedy of age. Near them, an old
woman became suddenly active. The sweep of her
chair increased as she glanced at Virginia. She
stopped and whispered to her neighbor.</p>

<p>This aged one started, as if awakened from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
slumber, and she, too, inspected the girl. Then, she placed
her lips by the ear of her deaf companion and in a
shrill voice of great carrying power, cried, &#8220;Powder
makes her look pale. They all use it nowadays.&#8221; She
stopped for breath and screamed, &#8220;Her dress is too
short. Her mother ought to have better sense than to
let her run around that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luckily for the embarrassed girl, at this moment
Mrs. Henderson led her into the reception room and
left her to regain her composure while she transacted
her business with the matron in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>The remarkable quiet which reigned in this home of
age oppressed Virginia, so that when Mrs. Henderson
returned with the matron, she cried, impulsively, &#8220;Oh,
Hennie, I am glad that you are back. This place is so
still that it is lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson turned to Mrs. Smith, the matron.
&#8220;That is what I have always said,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;The
old ladies like it quiet, but we overdo it here. The
place is a grave. We should have more entertainment.&#8221;
She looked questioningly at the girl. &#8220;What
do you think should be done, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s blue eyes were very serious as she answered,
&#8220;I hardly know&#8211;almost anything which
would make it happier. It needs something to stir it
up,&#8221; she ended impulsively.</p>

<p>The older woman laughed and Mrs. Henderson put
her arm about the girl&#8217;s waist, and suggested, &#8220;You
have nothing on your hands, child. Why can&#8217;t you
arrange some sort of an entertainment for these elderly
women?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she demurred shyly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>&#8220;Certainly you can, you are quite old enough to
undertake the task of making these old people happier
for an afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into the girl&#8217;s mind came a remembrance of her
birthday gift. &#8220;I will be glad to do it, Hennie,&#8221; she
agreed with great seriousness.</p>

<p>They paused at Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s gate as they returned
from the Lucinda Home. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you come
in, dear?&#8221; urged the older woman.</p>

<p>The girl, dreamily engaged in planning marvelous
but impossible entertainments for the stirring up of
the old ladies, did not hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and have tea with a solitary somebody?&#8221;
the widow begged the girl wistfully. &#8220;You think that
the Lucinda Home is lonesome, but don&#8217;t forget that
an old lady who loved your mother and who loves you
is lonesome, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest Hennie, you haven&#8217;t the slightest idea of
what loneliness is.&#8221; Virginia smiled sweetly at the
older woman and kissed her. &#8220;I would enjoy taking
tea with you but I must not forget my father. Probably
all afternoon he has been making plans to help
the people who work in his mill. I think he is so like
my mother&#8211;always trying to make other people happier.
You loved her, Hennie, and you know him. I
want you to help me to be unselfish like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this recital, Mrs. Henderson underwent a
severe test in self-repression, the high praise of Obadiah&#8217;s
disinterestedness nearly causing severe internal
injury. There was yet an ominous flash in her eye
as she bade the girl farewell.</p>

<p>Virginia found her father awaiting her. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
digestive organs were protesting by certain unpleasant
twinges, against the extra work he had forced upon
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; he demanded of her
sharply.</p>

<p>She dropped into the chair by his side. &#8220;At Mrs.
Henderson&#8217;s, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You left me alone,&#8221; he complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;You went to sleep and I was so lonesome, Daddy
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes no difference. You should not have
left me. You have the week days to yourself. I ought
to have your Sundays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sorry that I was so thoughtless,&#8221; Virginia
reproached herself, with a suspicion of tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you were thoughtless,&#8221; Obadiah grumbled.
&#8220;You must learn to think of others. Don&#8217;t get teary.
That always disturbs me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was engaged in a battle to keep back her
tears when the notes of a ragtime melody resounded
through the calm of the Sabbath evening. Ike approached.
The gorgeousness of his apparel eliminated
every variety of lily, except the tiger, from consideration.
His suit was of electric blue. His shirt was
white, broadly striped with royal purple, and it peeped
modestly from beneath a tie of crimson. His hat was
straw, decorated with a sash of more tints than the
bow of promise.</p>

<p>Ike was happy. He had loitered through the afternoon
before the meeting house of his faith, impressing
the brethren and the sisters with the magnificence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
of his attire. He deemed it, socially speaking, to have
been a perfect day.</p>

<p>It was now his intention to partake of refreshment
before returning again into the shadow of the sacred
edifice, not then, however, to give pleasure to the faithful
in general, but rather for the special and particular
delight of an amber hued maiden who at the moment
held his flitting fancy.</p>

<p>Filled with pleasant anticipations and in cadence
with his melody, Ike approached the house.</p>

<p>Obadiah arose hastily as the sweet tones struck his
ear and awaited the arrival of the musical one at the
edge of the porch.</p>

<p>At the sight of the gaunt form of the manufacturer,
a dulcet timbre departed from Ike&#8217;s performance and
as he approached, the volume of sound diminished in
proportion to the square of the distance. Opposite the
mill owner it ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening Misto Dale.&#8221; The voice was humbly
courteous.</p>

<p>Disdaining the kindly salutation of his hireling, Obadiah
made outcry. &#8220;I want the car. Get the car,&#8221; he
commanded.</p>

<p>Ike halted.</p>

<p>These were portentous words. The Dale car was
not often used on the seventh day. Ike himself
was opposed to the Sunday riding habit. Assuming a
confidential attitude towards his employer as if imparting
a secret of moment, he intimated, &#8220;Ah ain&#8217;
got no confidence in dat lef&#8217; han&#8217; hin&#8217; tiah, Misto Dale,
a tall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah glared at the tasty garb of his minion with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
disgust, and flew into a rage. &#8220;I pay you to put confidence
in that tire,&#8221; he bleated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r, yas&#8217;r,&#8221; Ike surrendered hurriedly. &#8220;Ah
gwine pump er li&#8217;l aiah in dat tiah. Dat fix &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Ike, shorn of his finery, returned with the
car, Virginia, in obedience to an abrupt invitation
from her father, was prepared to join him for the
ride.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s conscience did not usually trouble him;
but today, as the machine started and he settled himself
by his daughter, it struck him that she seemed unusually
pale. He could not well overlook, either, the
note of sadness which had played about the girl&#8217;s mouth
and eyes since his remarks to her. These things made
Obadiah uncomfortable. His explosion at Ike had
acted as a counter-irritant to his indigestion, and he
felt relieved.</p>

<p>They passed a woman driving a pretty runabout.
In times of great good feeling Obadiah had avowed
his intention of purchasing Virginia a light car which
she could drive herself. However, it took direct affirmative
action to persuade the mill owner to open
his check book even for his own family; and, as Virginia
had been contented with the big car and Ike to
drive it, nothing had ever come of the intention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice that runabout?&#8221; Obadiah inquired.
&#8220;How would one of that type suit you?&#8221; If he could
get Virginia to chatter along as usual, he could enjoy
his evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d like it,&#8221; she exclaimed. The girl was
thinking rapidly. Not for nothing was she Obadiah&#8217;s
daughter when it was necessary to take advantage of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
situation. &#8220;I thought that you had given up the idea
of getting me a car, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. It seemed to me that you were not
particularly interested in one.&#8221; He shrewdly placed
the responsibility for delay upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am <i>now</i>. More so than ever,&#8221; Virginia declared.
&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure before what kind of a car I wanted.
Now I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s enthusiasm in the proposed
purchase had cooled as hers increased.</p>

<p>She squeezed his arm up against her and announced
breathlessly, &#8220;I want a truck, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A truck!&#8221; Obadiah viewed his daughter as if he
deemed the immediate attentions of an alienist essential
in her case. &#8220;What on earth would you do with
a truck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need it to take those colored orphans out for a
ride each week,&#8221; she explained, full of the plan. &#8220;I
am going to have benches made to fit on each side of
the truck so that it will take them all comfortably.
Isn&#8217;t it a fine idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah, dumfounded for the moment, regained
speech and sought information as one who had not
heard aright. &#8220;Do you mean to say that you want
me to buy a truck to haul those negro children around
town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah&#8211;yah&#8211;yah.&#8221; Upon the front seat, Ike so
far forgot the proprieties of his station that he gave
vent to noisy merriment at the domestic perplexities of
gentlefolk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your mind on your business,&#8221; Obadiah commanded,
glaring at his chauffeur&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>Virginia, disregarding the <i>faux pas</i> of the chauffeur
and its condign reproof, proceeded to explain her plans.
&#8220;We have decided, Daddy, that those orphans must be
taken for a ride every week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has decided that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hennie and I have worked it all out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that woman got to do with it?&#8221; he
snapped. &#8220;Does she expect me to buy trucks to haul
all the negro children in town on pleasure trips?&#8221;</p>

<p>Violent paroxysms beset Ike and bent him as a sapling
in a gale.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s eyes glared at the black neck as if, discharging
X-rays, they might expose the chauffeur&#8217;s
malady.</p>

<p>Heedless of disturbing influences, Virginia went on,
&#8220;Hennie thought that this car was too small. She felt
that it would be better to get a truck which would
carry all the orphans than to use this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; interjected Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suggested to her that I would get you to loan us
a truck from the mill; but Hennie said that she was
sure that you wouldn&#8217;t let us have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem&#8211;ahem,&#8221; choked the mill owner, getting red
in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her that I knew you would be glad to let us
have it because you did so love to help people,&#8221; explained
Virginia with great pride.</p>

<p>Obadiah shifted uneasily in his seat. &#8220;What did
she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hennie said that she wished me success.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah relaxed as one relieved from strain.</p>

<p>Sensing the change in him, Virginia cuddled up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
her father full of happiness and contentment as if the
purchase of the truck was settled. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it sweet,
Daddy dear,&#8221; she murmured gently, &#8220;within an hour
after I talked to Hennie you offer to buy me a car?
Of course, you don&#8217;t care, so long as I am satisfied,
whether I choose a runabout or a truck.&#8221; She took his
hand and held it in her own, pressing it.</p>

<p>Obadiah appeared greatly interested in something
upon the skyline.</p>

<p>&#8220;A truck,&#8221; Virginia continued thoughtfully, &#8220;especially
a fine large one such as we would need&#8211;&#8221; Obadiah
flinched&#8211;&#8220;would be in the way. Our garage
wouldn&#8217;t hold it and Serena would object to it being
left in the yard.&#8221; She arrived at a sudden determination.
&#8220;Choose, Daddy, whether you will buy me a
truck or loan me one from the mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s response was not delayed. &#8220;You had
better use a mill truck,&#8221; he agreed with a sigh which
might have been of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Daddy. I can hardly wait to tell
Hennie,&#8221; she exclaimed, highly delighted at the outcome
of her efforts.</p>

<p>Obadiah leaned towards his chauffeur. &#8220;Ike,&#8221; he
ordered, &#8220;you get the new truck down at the mill, the
first thing in the morning. Run it out to Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s
house. Make all the row around her place you
wish. Tell her,&#8221; Obadiah continued, &#8220;that it is there
by my instructions, to take those negro orphans riding.&#8221;
He paused. &#8220;Ike,&#8221; he resumed more forcibly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you forget the noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r,&#8221; promised Ike with happy smiles of anticipation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;That will be a dandy joke on Hennie,&#8221; giggled
Virginia. &#8220;Go very early, Ike.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were following a boulevard which now brought
them to the Soldiers&#8217; Home. Its fine buildings and
large acreage were matters of great pride to South
Ridgefield. As they approached the central group of
edifices, they heard music.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stop for the band concert,&#8221; suggested Virginia.</p>

<p>Obadiah, much relieved physically and mentally from
recent disquietude, was unusually complaisant.
&#8220;Drive in, Ike,&#8221; he directed.</p>

<p>They turned into a broad, paved road which followed
the sides of a square about which were located
the principal buildings of the institution. It bounded
a tree shaded park with a band-stand in the center.
Walks radiating to the sides and corners of the square
were lined with benches occupied by veterans in campaign
hats and blue uniforms, smoking, chatting, and
enjoying the music.</p>

<p>The inner edge of the roadway was lined with automobiles
full of visitors. Ike stopped upon the opposite
side, in front of the quarters of the Commanding
Officer.</p>

<p>Hardly had they paused when a tall, fine looking
man of a distinctly military bearing, despite his white
hair, hurried out to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dale,&#8221; he greeted the manufacturer in a big
booming voice, &#8220;I am glad to welcome you to the
Home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah genially returned the salutation of Colonel
Ryan. That officer, being a man of rank, in charge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
the Soldiers&#8217; Home, with power of recommendation in
government purchases, was one whose acquaintance it
was wise for even wealthy mill owners to cultivate.</p>

<p>When presented to Virginia, the Colonel bowed
deeply. &#8220;I want you to come up to the house and
meet Mrs. Ryan,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;You can hear the music
more comfortably there. I am proud of my band.
They are old fellows like you and me, Dale, but give
them a horn and they have lots of musical &#8216;pep&#8217; left.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan met them at the head of the porch steps.
&#8220;You have often heard me speak of Mr. Dale,&#8221; the
Colonel, discreetly noncommittal as to his manner of
speaking, reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, and I have heard of you, too.&#8221; She
smiled at Virginia and explained to Obadiah, &#8220;I happen
to have a good friend in that splendid Mrs. Henderson,
your neighbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mill owner received this information with little
enthusiasm, but, learning that Mrs. Ryan was a victim
of rheumatism, he advocated the use of a liniment prepared
by his father and applied with remarkable results
to both man and beast. Obadiah was hazy upon the
mixture&#8217;s ingredients but was clear upon its curative
qualities. Mrs. Ryan evincing marked interest, the
manufacturer entertained her with the intimate details
of miraculous recoveries.</p>

<p>Neither Virginia nor the Colonel being rheumatic,
they failed to give Obadiah&#8217;s discourse the rapt interest
of a true brother in pain. Their attention wavered,
wandered and failed, and the band played a crashing
air; but the rheumatic heeded not.</p>

<p>All hope of a general conversation having departed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
the Colonel praised his band to Virginia. &#8220;Every man
in that organization is over sixty years old,&#8221; he
bragged. &#8220;They get as much pleasure out of playing
as their audience does from their concert. It&#8217;s a great
band.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They <i>do</i> play well,&#8221; the girl agreed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
wonder that you are proud of them. I love a brass
band, myself. You do, too, Colonel Ryan. I can tell
by your face, when they play.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Colonel grinned boyishly. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted,
&#8220;I think a band is one of humanity&#8217;s boons. I can&#8217;t
get close enough to one, when they are playing, to satisfy
me. I have to have some sort of an excuse to do
that, now-a-days&#8211;you&#8217;ll do fine&#8211;let&#8217;s go nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The medical lecture was disturbed, that the audience
might nod understandingly to its husband, as they departed.</p>

<p>The Colonel chatted gaily. In the presence of a
pretty woman he was a typical soldier. About them
were the benches filled with the white headed veterans,
as they entered the square. But a few years and these
had been the fighting men of the country&#8211;its defence&#8211;playing
parts modest or heroic on a hundred
half forgotten battle fields. Now, they, too, bowed
with age, rested in their years, and waited&#8211;waited
calmly, as true soldiers should, with the taste of good
tobacco upon their lips and the blare of martial music
in their ears, the coming of the ever nearing shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have I never heard this band down town,
Colonel Ryan? It is a shame when they play so beautifully.
Do they charge for concerts?&#8221; asked Virginia,
as an idea developed behind the blue eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;People want young and handsome men to play for
them if they pay for it,&#8221; laughed Colonel Ryan. &#8220;So
my old codgers don&#8217;t get many chances of that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has charge of the band?&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s manner
meant business.</p>

<p>The Colonel loved a pretty face. He was enjoying
himself. &#8220;Do you want to object to the leader about
his interpretation of a favorite air?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tease, Colonel Ryan,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;I
want to know who has authority to make engagements
for the band. Please be serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You frighten me into submission, Miss Dale. Do
you wish to engage the band?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, Colonel Ryan.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice was almost
imploring.</p>

<p>He looked down into the depths of the pleading eyes.
Never in his long life had he refused a pretty woman
anything, and it is doubtful if he could have done so.
Yet, he desired to prolong the pleasure of the moment.
&#8220;May I ask, without undue curiosity, for what purpose
you desire the organization?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want them to give a concert for the old ladies
at the Lucinda Home,&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>Colonel Ryan choked. He recovered himself
quickly. Military training is of value in difficult moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was over there this afternoon, Colonel Ryan.
The place was so lonesome that I thought it needed
some excitement. They asked me to give an entertainment.
Your band would be the very thing. It plays
so loud that even the deaf ladies could hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He who had borne the burden of a regiment of men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
bowed sympathetically, but his face and neck displayed
symptoms of apoplexy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lucinda Home is a graveyard, Colonel Ryan.
When I see all of these old men sitting around and
talking and smoking while the band plays lively airs
to them, it makes me sorry for those women. I should
love to live here. But I should die over there. It is
dreadful to be lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Ryan agreed with great gravity.</p>

<p>Virginia waxed forceful. &#8220;Those old ladies should
be made as happy as these soldiers,&#8221; she argued.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t a woman as good as a man, Colonel Ryan?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Commandant by his silence refused this challenge
to a discussion upon woman&#8217;s rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those old ladies should have everything that these
men have,&#8221; maintained the girl, with great emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Including tobacco?&#8221; suggested the Colonel solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not.&#8221; Blue eyes snapped indignantly.</p>

<p>The boyish look was back in the Colonel&#8217;s face. &#8220;I
only wanted to be sure,&#8221; he explained soberly. &#8220;It
has a very important place here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Colonel Ryan, you will joke, and I am so in
earnest.&#8221; Her eyes were dark and tender and a soft
pink flushed her cheeks. &#8220;A concert at the Lucinda
Home would be a wonderful thing if I could get your
band.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can,&#8221; the Colonel promised, laconically, &#8220;and
it won&#8217;t cost you a cent.&#8221; He became enthusiastic, &#8220;It
will be a fine treat for the old ladies and my boys will
enjoy it, too. I&#8217;ll have to warn the old rascals about
flirting,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;They think that they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
regular devils among the ladies. I think that I will have
to come along myself to keep the old boys from breaking
any ancient hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come, Colonel Ryan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely. You may count on me. Are there to be
refreshments?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;yes!&#8221; She had never given a thought to
them before, and when she considered the food that it
would take it almost frightened her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My old boys can eat as well as ever, particularly if
it is soft stuff. That band has less teeth than any
similar organization in the world. It is the toothless
wonder,&#8221; chuckled the Colonel. &#8220;Be sure that you
have plenty to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they ascended the steps of the Colonel&#8217;s porch,
Virginia warned him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t mention the concert to
my father. I want to surprise him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found that Obadiah had exhausted his praises
of the marvelous liniment. Mrs. Ryan was now talking,
and, though the subject-matter was the same, the
mill owner was not a reciprocal listener. He felt that
an immediate departure for home was necessary.</p>

<p>The Dale car rolled away from the Soldiers&#8217; Home,
leaving the Commanding Officer standing, hat in hand,
upon the curb. A broad smile broke over his face.
&#8220;A band concert at the Lucinda Home,&#8221; he chuckled.
&#8220;You might as well give one out in the cemetery.&#8221;
His face softened. &#8220;Bless her heart,&#8221; he whispered,
as he turned back towards his house.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>HEZEKIAH HAS A SOLUTION</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Jones had finished transcribing Obadiah Dale&#8217;s
morning dictation and awaited a fitting moment to
place the letters before the manufacturer to receive
his signature. Meanwhile, he smoked a cigarette and,
with his face sadly distorted on account of the smoke,
manicured his nails with his pocket knife.</p>

<p>This important part of a gentleman&#8217;s toilet would
gladly have been left by Mr. Jones to a professional
manicurist, because of the more skilled attention and
the valuable social privileges attached to such services,
had not the chronically depleted condition of his purse
demanded the exercise of rigorous economy.</p>

<p>In the glare of the pendant bulb, Kelly was engaged
artistically in the preparation of a crude but libelous
cartoon of the stenographer.</p>

<p>A moment of rest and mental relaxation had descended
upon the personal staff of Obadiah. His hive
of commercial industry had, for the moment, ceased
to buzz. Suddenly, the hall door was thrown open.
Mr. Jones suffered a severe laceration from the point
of his own blade. Even the artistic soul of Kelly was
shaken by the abrupt intrusion.</p>

<p>Hezekiah Wilkins entered. His manner was hurried.
Not as a messenger bearing joyous news of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
great triumphs, but rather as an emissary charged
with intelligence of bitter flavor, who desires to get
rid of it, that he may turn to happier matters.</p>

<p>Having been courteously advised by the bleeding
outer guard that the manufacturer was not engaged at
the moment, Hezekiah entered the inner citadel.
Obadiah was reading a voluminous mass of typewritten
pages which he laid aside at the coming of his attorney.
Waving the lawyer to a chair, he intimated
that he awaited the further pleasure of his legal adviser.</p>

<p>Seating himself, Hezekiah shoved both of his feet
as far in front of him as his short legs would permit.
He studied the aspect of his shoes thus presented, as
if he had never before appreciated their beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Obadiah spoke curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to discuss the matter of that young man in
the hospital. Curtis is his name&#8211;I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Obadiah agreed.</p>

<p>Hezekiah placed his palms together and gazed upwards
as if in pious meditation upon the words which
he was about to utter.</p>

<p>Obadiah viewed the attitude of his adviser with
disapprobation. &#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; he urged roughly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t take all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer gave his employer a look of reproof.
&#8220;It is very important,&#8221; he announced with great calmness,
&#8220;that legal matters be accurately presented so
that the facts deduced shall afford a sound basis for
correct judgment when appearing in court.&#8221; Hezekiah
explained with dignity. &#8220;I have found that a moment
given to the correct logical presentation of facts tends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
to expedite a just solution of perplexing questions.&#8221;
As he ceased speaking, he appeared to drift away into
a condition of deep cogitation under the very eyes of
his employer.</p>

<p>Before this display of profound thought, Obadiah
was helpless. Properly chastened, he awaited in patience
the outcome of the mental processes of his learned
subordinate.</p>

<p>After a period in which no sound was heard but the
ticking of the clock, Hezekiah recovered from his abstraction
with a start, and announced, &#8220;This young
Curtis refuses to accept your check.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bigger fool he,&#8221; Obadiah responded with indifference.</p>

<p>Hezekiah turned sharply upon the mill owner, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t agree with you at all,&#8221; he rapped.</p>

<p>Obadiah had great confidence in the judgment of
his legal adviser. There had been times when failing
to follow it had cost him money. He became uneasy.
&#8220;Do you think that he has a case against me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have his chances before a jury than
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he going to bring suit?&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s uneasiness
increased. He did not care to be at the mercy
of a South Ridgefield jury. He usually was stuck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s my opinion that he intends to bring an
action against you. He displayed marked animus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He displayed what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Animus&#8211;unfriendliness,&#8221; Hezekiah interpreted.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s uneasiness affected his temper. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you speak English?&#8221; he demanded, the pitch of
his voice getting higher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>For an instant there was a flash in Hezekiah&#8217;s eyes
but when he spoke he was perfectly calm. &#8220;I beg
pardon, I failed to make allowances for&#8211;your understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah regarded his attorney angrily but made no
reply. Years of experience had warned him against
verbal combat with this man. Usually he did not
awaken to the danger until he rankled under one of
Hezekiah&#8217;s darts.</p>

<p>Disregarding the exchange of compliments, the lawyer
went on, perfectly unruffled, &#8220;Is there a reason for
this young man to entertain ill will against you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of the fellow before,&#8221; protested
Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he acquainted with your daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Obadiah hesitated after his denial and
modified it. &#8220;She helped to take him to the hospital
and she has visited him since, I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Comprehension lighted Hezekiah&#8217;s face.
&#8220;You told me,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;that your daughter
considered herself to be to blame for the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Obadiah agreed with reluctance. &#8220;Virginia
has a silly idea that she was at fault. She felt
very badly over the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And went to the hospital to express her regret and
conceded responsibility for the accident to the injured
man. He told me that he could rely on your daughter
as a witness in his behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be hanged,&#8221; cried Obadiah, the tone of his voice
reminding one of Hennie&#8217;s likening of him to a mosquito.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be stung with a fat verdict if he gets you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
into court with your own daughter testifying against
you. That&#8217;s what will happen to you. Probably she
admitted responsibility in the presence of witnesses,&#8221;
Hezekiah pointed out with deepest pessimism.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have my daughter dragged into court as
a witness against me,&#8221; groaned Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to stop it? Ship her out of
the state?&#8221; Hezekiah suggested with a promptness
which displayed unethical resourcefulness in the suppression
of embarrassing witnesses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you arrange a compromise?&#8221; begged
Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not after this mistake.&#8221; Hezekiah returned the
check for twenty-five dollars. &#8220;I&#8217;m as popular as a
mouse in a pantry with that young fellow after attempting
to pass that on him.&#8221; He gave the mill
owner a glance of curiosity. &#8220;How far would you
let me go now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use your own judgment, only keep Virginia out
of court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men were silent for a time and then the lawyer
spoke. &#8220;I tried to sound young Curtis. I endeavored
to discover if he had any settlement in mind. All
I found was a pronounced hostility to you personally
and,&#8221; Hezekiah smiled reminiscently, &#8220;to me as your
representative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your imagination,&#8221; exclaimed Obadiah and
then, after the custom of a malefactor of great wealth,
went on, &#8220;How can we get at him? He must be got
at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might suggest something&#8211;,&#8221; Hezekiah appeared
doubtful, lacking in his usual assurance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>It irritated Obadiah to have this man upon whose
judgment he had staked his fortune display indecision
in this trivial affair. &#8220;Out with it! What&#8217;s the matter
with you? Have you got cold feet?&#8221; he stormed.</p>

<p>Hezekiah chuckled. &#8220;This case is complicated.
The other side is most unfriendly. It&#8217;s pretty hard
to keep out of court when the other fellow wants to
put you there,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;I believe that I see a way
if you will give me full authority to make such settlement
as I deem advisable and,&#8221; Hezekiah shifted uneasily,
&#8220;allow me the assistance of counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hezekiah Wilkins, have you gone crazy? Do
you mean to ask me to hire another lawyer to help
you in this insignificant automobile case?&#8221; groaned
Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t asked you to employ a lawyer. I asked
for counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Mike, whose counsel do you require
in this tempest in a teapot?&#8221; shouted the exasperated
mill owner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, with your permission, to ask your daughter
Virginia to be of counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunderation,&#8221; bawled Obadiah, shrilly, exploding
with pent up aggravation. &#8220;Have you gone out of
your wits?&#8221; He surveyed the lawyer as if he really
believed his legal mentality to be addled. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I
get it into your head&#8211;&#8221; he cast a look of utter contempt
at the massive cranium of the lawyer&#8211;&#8220;that
my interest in this case is to keep my daughter out of
court? If it wasn&#8217;t for her, I&#8217;d let that brittle shanked
motorcycling ass sue until they grow bananas in
Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>&#8220;Your verbal pyrotechnics are interesting but hardly
germane to the subject,&#8221; Hezekiah reproved his employer.
&#8220;I have no intention of dragging your daughter
into court in the guise of a Portia, although her
beauty would<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s temper was on edge. &#8220;Come to the point,
sir,&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Cut out the hot air. My time
is worth money.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Hezekiah gazed thoughtfully out of
a window making strange gestures with his glasses.
Then, turning to the mill owner he smilingly agreed.
&#8220;As much valuable time has been utilized by you in
prolix descriptions, possibly amusing, assuredly slanderous
and not tending in the slightest degree to shed
light upon our problem, I admit a necessity for expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah viewed his attorney with wrathful eyes
but remained silent.</p>

<p>Even under the angry eyes of his employer a benignant
look lighted the countenance of the lawyer and
his voice was very gentle as he resumed, &#8220;It&#8217;s an old
adage&#8211;&#8216;Youth will be served.&#8217; In its arrogance,
youth defies the wisdom of age and the judgment of
the ages. In its careless irresponsibility, it knows not
danger. In its assurance and self-confidence it knows
not fear. Clad in the armor of health, it basks in the
sunshine of its strength and blatantly rejoices in its
hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hezekiah Wilkins, are you sick, or what in the
devil is the matter with you?&#8221; inquired the overwrought
manufacturer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not sick, Obadiah,&#8221; Hezekiah explained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
placidly, &#8220;not sick, but happy&#8211;happy in that thought&#8211;a
distinctly attractive one, and exceptionally well-developed
for your benefit. I regret,&#8221; the lawyer lamented,
&#8220;that a stenographer was not present to preserve
it. It is a pity that the world should lose it&#8211;that
it should be lost to those who would understand
and appreciate it&#8211;even love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah sank deep into his chair, encircled by gloom,
as, appreciating his inability to direct the train of his
legal adviser&#8217;s thought, he allowed that worthy to pursue
his own course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Youth calls to youth,&#8221; the sentimental Hezekiah
continued. &#8220;Youth understands youth. Youth can
persuade youth.&#8221; Suddenly the attorney seemed to
thrust aside the gentle atmosphere in which he had been
immersed, and, fixing a most crafty look upon Obadiah,
he snapped, &#8220;You and I can&#8217;t handle that fellow, but
your daughter can. It&#8217;s going to cost you some money,
though.&#8221; He suffered a relapse. &#8220;Youth knows
neither the value of time nor money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah was filled with relief. &#8220;By gum, you&#8217;ve
hit it,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;But why couldn&#8217;t you get that
off your chest without throwing a fit?&#8221; he complained,
ill-humoredly.</p>

<p>Once more Hezekiah reverted to sentiment. &#8220;The
language of youth is song, and its thought poetry,&#8221; he
sighed, after which he arose and faced the manufacturer
across his desk. &#8220;I am authorized to proceed
in accordance with my plan?&#8221; he asked&#8211;&#8220;to make
the best settlement which in my judgment can be made
in the premises, through,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;the extraordinary
channels to which I have recourse?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;Go the limit, only keep it out of court,&#8221; grumbled
Obadiah. &#8220;Give such instructions as you wish to
Virginia and let her understand that I am only interested
in an amicable adjustment and do not care to be
bothered with details.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Hezekiah departed through the outer office, he
interrupted a conversation between Mr. Jones and
Kelly.</p>

<p>The stenographer met the intrusion with characteristic
activity. Rushing to his desk, he seized the
recently typed letters and bore them into Obadiah&#8217;s
presence. His haste, if noted by the attorney, should
have indicated that prolonged presence in the throne
room had resulted in marked delay to the normal performance
of imperial functions.</p>

<p>Apparently Hezekiah&#8217;s mind was engrossed by
lighter matters. He moved spryly, whistling a cheery
melody not at present in vogue but much in favor in
his youth.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones came out of Obadiah&#8217;s room hurriedly.
The sound of stern reproof came also, until it was
shut off by the closing of the door. It seemed as if
the spirit of the stenographer expanded in relief, in
the familiar atmosphere of his own domain; as one
who, having accomplished a hazardous journey, returns
to the peace of his own fireside.</p>

<p>He entered Kelly&#8217;s room with great dignity. Taking
a position in the center, he raised his arms horizontally,
inhaled a deep breath, bowed deeply, straightened
up, exhaled, rose on his toes, descended, and
dropped his arms.</p>

<p>The massive Kelly viewed this athletic exhibition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
with interest. &#8220;What&#8217;s that exercise for?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones yawned. &#8220;It gives me relaxation from
the strain,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What strain? Where did you strain yourself?&#8221;
asked Kelly with kindly interest in his friend&#8217;s welfare.</p>

<p>&#8220;The office responsibility,&#8221; explained the stenographer.
&#8220;It knocks the sap out of a fellow.&#8221; He
lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that it?&#8221; Kelly gave a cruel laugh. &#8220;I
thought you had sprung something. If you do that
exercise often, young fellow, you&#8217;ll bust a lung. Let&#8217;s
see you do it again,&#8221; urged the bookkeeper, as if desirous
of witnessing the fulfillment of his prophecy.</p>

<p>Without fear, Mr. Jones laid aside his cigarette
with care, and gulped such a deep draught of air that
he became red in the face and gave other evidences of
being about to burst from undue pneumatic pressure.</p>

<p>Kelly viewed with undisguised amusement the undeveloped
protuberance thrust forward in pride by the
stenographer. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t the chest expansion of
a lizard,&#8221; he told him.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones received this deadly insult in the midst
of deep bowing. He exploded, and, leaning against a
desk, breathed rapidly while the injured look in his
eyes attempted to carry that reproof which his speechlessness
otherwise forbade.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do that exercise much,&#8221; Kelly gloomily predicted,
&#8220;you are going to relax in a wooden box.
Who gave you that stuff? You must have been getting
your ideas from the gymnasium of a bug house.&#8221;</p>

<p>For obvious reasons Mr. Jones failed to reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>&#8220;There is no sense in the thing. What you need
is&#8211;&#8221; Kelly descended from his perch and seizing him,
only that instant recovered from speechlessness, in his
strong grasp, made exploratory investigations with
his fingers throughout the panting one&#8217;s anatomy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch,&#8221; wailed the pained Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up. Do you want the old man out here?
I&#8217;m not going to hurt you. I want to find out what
ails you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leggo, you are nearly killing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones rubbed himself ruefully when Kelly
loosed him. &#8220;You big stiff, ain&#8217;t you got no sense,
gouging around in a fellow&#8217;s insides that way? You
are liable to put a man out of business,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>Utterly indifferent to these complaints, Kelly was
judging the stenographer coldly and dispassionately.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got no bone. You&#8217;ve got no muscle. You&#8217;ve
got no fat.&#8221; Kelly forgot that pride and dignity are
intangible assets. &#8220;You&#8217;d better take correct breathing
exercises or you&#8217;ll get T. B.,&#8221; he told him. &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you&#8217;ve got it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally, Mr. Jones was greatly alarmed and
showed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the way to take a breathing exercise.&#8221;
Kelly slowly inhaled a mighty volume of air until his
chest arched forth in all of its magnificent development.
He held it so for a moment and beat upon it
resoundingly in accordance with the supposed custom
of the orang-outang in moments of victory. &#8220;No
tuberculosis there,&#8221; he boasted, after exhaling with the
rush of a gale of wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some expansion, Kelly,&#8221; the stenographer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
admitted, and he continued as in excuse for his own
physical deficiencies, &#8220;I should take more exercise.
My work is confining, and the strain is heavy. I&#8217;m
all run down. The old man must have noticed it, too,
because the other day he says to me, &#8216;Mr. Jones, you&#8217;re
working too hard&#8211;it&#8217;s telling on you&#8211;I&#8217;d give you
a good rest if I could manage to get along without
you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly burst into a roar of laughter. &#8220;If you wait
for the old man to give you a rest, my son, you are
going to get tired, believe me. Cut out the bluff for
a minute. I want to talk seriously to you. You&#8217;re in
rotten physical condition and you owe it to yourself to
keep from playing leading man at a funeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones&#8217;s countenance registered horror.</p>

<p>Kelly went on. &#8220;I happen to know a darn sight
more about physical training than I do about book-keeping.
I ought to&#8211;I spent enough time around
a college gymnasium when I should have been some
place else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Mr. Jones&#8217;s alarm faded before this astounding
information. &#8220;College,&#8221; he remarked in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Kelly grinned, &#8220;I spent a couple of years in
college. I&#8217;m proud of them. I nearly flunked out before
I learned that I leaned to muscle instead of to literature.&#8221;
He returned to the subject under discussion.
&#8220;I can give you a bunch of exercises which will do
you a lot of good in six months if you are faithful.
I&#8217;ll give you gentle exercises at first, darn gentle,&#8221; he
laughed, &#8220;otherwise you&#8217;ll snap something. I believe
that I&#8217;ll make a man out of you, young grasshopper.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
He shook his head wearily. &#8220;Gosh, but it&#8217;s going to
take a lot of work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones flushed hotly. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s
not necessary to insult me, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve got to use a harpoon to get anything
through that rhinoceros&#8217; hide of egotism of yours.&#8221;
He fastened a stern and foreboding eye upon Mr.
Jones. &#8220;Do you want to die?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones sought the motive behind the startling
question. &#8220;What&#8217;s going to kill me?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lack of air.&#8221; Kelly&#8217;s answer was obscure. It
was too general. He thought it necessary to restate
it with modifying amendments. &#8220;The lack of good
fresh air,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mr. Jones, apparently much relieved at
the distinction made.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to get out into the air and breathe,&#8221;
Kelly explained as if the stenographer were carelessly
given to omit this function.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have the time.&#8221; Mr. Jones visualized a
dignified stroll over a golf links.</p>

<p>Kelly gave thought to the difficulty. &#8220;A motorcycle
would be the thing,&#8221; he decided.</p>

<p>The effect upon Mr. Jones would have been no different
if Kelly had prescribed an aeroplane or a submarine.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t ride a motorcycle, and even if I
could, where can I get one?&#8221; he objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point.&#8221; Kelly was as enthusiastic as
a life insurance agent. &#8220;I have a friend who has
one. He nearly killed himself on it and now he is
in the hospital. I&#8217;ll bet that he is tired of it and will
sell it cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>&#8220;What do I want with the thing if it nearly killed
him?&#8221; Mr. Jones protested logically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool. The motorcycle never hurt him.
He ran into an automobile and hurt himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones believed the difference to be immaterial.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t ride a motorcycle,&#8221; he declared obstinately.</p>

<p>Kelly clung to his scheme with constructive pride.
&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you, my friend,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;You are
going to die unless you get out into the air. I suggest
the way to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll get killed on the blamed old motorcycle,&#8221;
predicted Mr. Jones mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your choice!&#8221; the generous Kelly invited.
&#8220;I am going up to the hospital to see that fellow after
office hours. Why don&#8217;t you come along and meet
him and then you can decide about the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, fearful that he might overlook an important
engagement, consulted a note-book with care.
After concluding his investigation of the records, he
said, &#8220;Well, as I don&#8217;t happen to have anything on,
I don&#8217;t mind going up there with you, but you can
write it in your hat that I&#8217;m not strong for any motorcycle
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a few moments after the prescribed closing
hour, Obadiah&#8217;s official staff appeared upon the streets
of South Ridgefield. Their steps lead them towards
the hospital and on the way they passed Mr. Vivian&#8217;s
cool oasis of refreshment amidst the burning sands of
the town&#8217;s business section.</p>

<p>Here, the confectioner and his assistants arrayed
in pure white moved gracefully about, serving the
guests with cooling drink or, from time to time, gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
attention to the adjustment of the mechanical piano
which furnished melody for the lovers of music.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones feasted his eyes upon this scene of innocent
revelry and good fellowship. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; he
said to Kelly, &#8220;have a drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly received the invitation with insulting words.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your trouble,&#8221; he exclaimed in a voice which
carried far. &#8220;That&#8217;s what makes your complexion
so fierce.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sensitive soul of Mr. Jones rebelled at this public
outcry of his physical defects. &#8220;Say, you big
chump,&#8221; he burst out, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know any better than
to bawl a fellow out that way in a place where everybody
can hear you? That&#8217;s a dickens of a thing to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on. Nobody was listening.&#8221; Kelly looked
about as if disappointed at failing to find an audience
awaiting other personal allusions. &#8220;It&#8217;s the truth,&#8221;
he maintained vigorously.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones hesitated, torn as many another good man,
between his vanity and his appetite. Before his eyes
flowed a tantalizing stream of those delicacies so dear
to his palate. In his pocket reposed two dimes, his
wealth until pay day on the morrow would replenish
his purse. Why should not a good fellow entertain
his friends even though they resort to personal comments?
Rent by conflicting desires, he jingled the
coins. As he fingered them, there flashed the remembrance
of the war tax. He turned to Kelly and his
voice was very sad, as he murmured, &#8220;I guess that
you&#8217;re right, old man. We&#8217;ll cut out the sweet stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had no difficulty in locating Joe Curtis. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
sunny characteristics had won him already wide spread
friendships among the hospital staff, so that the way
to his bed was indicated as the path to a neighbor&#8217;s
door.</p>

<p>Kelly grinned amiably at Miss Knight, and inquired,
&#8220;May I speak to Joe Curtis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse looked at the big fellow with the appraising
eye of a connoisseur of men. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; she retorted,
&#8220;if you can talk and he will give you a chance
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The participants in this repartee were much pleased
with its cleverness. They laughed loudly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, considering the remarks frivolous, did
not deign to unbend from a stately poise assumed by
him when in the presence of ladies. Miss Knight was
evidently a person of ordinary origin, lacking in discrimination.
She had failed to notice the stenographer,
confining her attentions, including her smiles,
to the husky Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s another friend, Joe,&#8221; the nurse told the
injured motorcyclist when they arrived at his bedside.
She failed to take account of Mr. Jones who had
progressed down the aisle with mien of great distinction.
His entrance was marred only by a remark
of a vulgar patient who in a coarse whisper desired to
be advised, &#8220;Who let Charlie Chaplin in?&#8221; much to
the amusement of other low fellows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Joe, how&#8217;s business?&#8221; asked Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, Mike, fine. Never better,&#8221; responded the
patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet my friend, Mr. Percy Jones.&#8221; The introduction
was impaired as the stenographer&#8217;s attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
was devoted to frowning down masculine giggles reminiscent
of the reference to the illustrious movie star.</p>

<p>That the social exigencies of the moment might not
be overlooked, Kelly dug a finger into the stenographer&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones undulated as to a measure of the Hula
Hula. &#8220;Wough,&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Wot cher doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Happy laughter arose from nearby beds.</p>

<p>Miss Knight swept her recumbent charges with a
glance of stern reproof. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your manners?&#8221;
she demanded. &#8220;Cut out this rough stuff or&#8211;&#8221; she
paused for effect and then launched this terrifying
threat&#8211;&#8220;you&#8217;ll get no ice cream on Wednesday.&#8221;
The male surgical cases quailed before this menace
of cruel and unusual punishment. Peace reigned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, be seated,&#8221; invited Joe, in the rich
and mellow tones of an interlocutor.</p>

<p>Miss Knight departed. Mr. Jones sat down in the
only chair and Kelly made preparations to rest his
huge form on the bed of the injured one.</p>

<p>Joe viewed this arrangement with alarm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you sit on my broken leg, you hippopotamus,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>Kelly withdrew so hastily that he nearly knocked Mr.
Jones off his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike, go over there and get that other chair.
Don&#8217;t try to rob a little fellow like Jonesy,&#8221; Joe told
him.</p>

<p>Pain swathed the features of Mr. Jones. To be
publicly addressed as &#8220;Jonesy&#8221; was bad enough, but
when coupled with an insulting reference to his size,
it was too much.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>Kelly finally seated himself by the invalid&#8217;s head and
remarked with a smile of pleasure, &#8220;Joe, they tell
me you&#8217;re about dead. Is there anything in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to words of warning,&#8221; suggested the injured
man. &#8220;Even with my game leg, it would take
a bigger man than you to put me out of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly disregarded the challenge. &#8220;Is there any
truth in the report that landing on your head is all
that saved you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe grunted in disdain and Mr. Jones openly
yawned at such commonplace humor.</p>

<p>Regardless of popular displeasure, Kelly went on.
&#8220;I understand that your head ruined the truck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike, you are a heavy kidder.&#8221; Joe smiled affectionately
at his big friend. &#8220;Your conversation
is usually agreeable, sometimes interesting, but never
reliable. You guessed wrong about a truck. I ran
into a seven passenger touring car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, a chariot of the awful rich. In the excitement
did you surreptitiously abstract any diamonds,
tires, gasoline or other valuables shaken loose by your
dome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such luck, Mike. There was only a girl in
the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The priceless jewel of the Isle of Swat and you
did not kidnap it?&#8221; exclaimed Kelly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones displayed a superior interest. &#8220;Was she
beautiful?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she beautiful?&#8221; mimicked Kelly. &#8220;She
must have been. That&#8217;s why Joe tried to make a hit.&#8221;
He leaned over the motorcyclist. &#8220;For once I am
proud of you, young man. You used your head.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>Mr. Jones displayed extreme animation. &#8220;By
Jove,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Possibly the lady thought that
Mr. Curtis was butting in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly inspected the stenographer with great intentness.
&#8220;Good morning, old top. When did you wake
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your kidding is contagious, Mike. Jonesy has
caught it,&#8221; chuckled Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t understand the nature of the brute.
It&#8217;s not me&#8211;it&#8217;s the ladies. Jones awakens at a reference
to them and blossoms beneath their smiles,&#8221; explained
Kelly.</p>

<p>A gentle look spread over Joe&#8217;s face. &#8220;The girl
I ran into happened to be the right sort. She stuck
by me when I was hurt and helped to bring me here&#8211;&#8221;
He paused for a moment and then continued, &#8220;Let&#8217;s
not talk about her in this room full of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; boomed Kelly. &#8220;You&#8217;re right as usual,
Joe. Never stopped to think myself.&#8221; He turned
and pointed to the stenographer. &#8220;My old friend
Jones is on the edge of a decline.&#8221; The bookkeeper
disregarded the presence of the private secretary as
if he were deaf. &#8220;If he starts to slide he hasn&#8217;t far
to go to land in a cemetery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones displayed no marked pleasure in the conversation.
He maintained a dignified aloofness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have decided to train him,&#8221; Kelly explained.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a hard job. He&#8217;s got no bone. He&#8217;s
got no muscle. He&#8217;s got no fat. He&#8217;s got nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Kelly overlooked the proud and sensitive spirit
which protested against this public dissection of physical
defects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>The eyes of Kelly and Joe viewed the puny figure
of the stenographer in the manner of disgusted farmers
examining a runt which resists their efforts to fatten
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;To get flesh and muscle and bone on him I must
give him plenty of exercise and get him out into the
air. That will make him eat,&#8221; Kelly went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;His present diet is mostly cigarettes, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Joe inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;He eats them by the bale,&#8221; confessed Kelly.</p>

<p>Apparently Joe deemed himself invited into the case
as a consulting specialist. &#8220;Make him cut them out,&#8221;
he prescribed. &#8220;Take the little fellow out for a run
every night and give him a good sweat out. Give him
a bath and a rub down and get him in bed by ten
o&#8217;clock. Watch your distances at first. Jonesy is
full of dope. Look at his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones quailed under this keen scrutiny of experts.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll fall dead if he runs a block,&#8221; predicted Joe.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be able to cover some ground, though, after a
couple of weeks of plugging. You can speed him up,
then.&#8221; He studied the stenographer with impersonal
interest. &#8220;Make a feather weight boxer of him, Mike,
if he isn&#8217;t yellow. Get him in shape for the fall meet
of the Athletic Club. If he can&#8217;t box, make him run.
He&#8217;s built like a jack rabbit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The course of treatment outlined by the consulting
specialist filled Mr. Jones with undisguised alarm.
His mind and body alike protested against the indignities
which threatened him. To him came recognition
that immediate resistance was necessary to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
prevent the advent of a gruelling course of physical training,
repugnant to his flesh and revolting to his soul.
&#8220;S-s-s-say,&#8221; he stammered in the intenseness of his
opposition, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; Joe interrupted with fierceness, &#8220;you
asked Mike to train you, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones&#8217;s mental anguish did not make for quick
thinking. He worked his lips but emitted no sound.</p>

<p>To Joe this silence acquiesced in his assumption and
he went on, &#8220;You begged him to train you and he
finally consented. You have shown judgment in
selecting him&#8211;you couldn&#8217;t find a better man. But,
remember this, my friend. Training is hard work.
You are in for a rough time of it, Jonesy, and don&#8217;t
you forget it. Remember this&#8211;it&#8217;s not what you
want&#8211;it&#8217;s what Mike wants that is going to count.
He has undertaken the devil&#8217;s own job to make a man
out of a shrimp like you. Do you get me?&#8221; he concluded
ferociously.</p>

<p>Before the sheer brute masculinity of the attack, the
gentle courage of Mr. Jones gave way. &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221;
he agreed meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s all settled, Mike,&#8221; Joe indicated with
satisfaction. &#8220;Jonesy knows where he gets off. How
about the grub?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No trouble there,&#8221; Kelly explained. &#8220;We board
at the same place. The food is plain enough and I
can eat his dessert and make him fill up on solid stuff.
I wanted to ask about your motorcycle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome to use it, Mike. It will be fine
to chase Jonesy on or to get ahead of him if you want
to time him. The machine was badly smashed in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
crash. There is a repair bill of seven dollars
against it. If you will pay that, you can use it until
I need it again. Put Jones up on it, too, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a rustling of skirts and the sound of soft
footsteps. Virginia came towards the young men.
Mr. Jones and Kelly instantly recognized their employer&#8217;s
daughter. They came to their feet as kitchen
police in the presence of the Commanding General,
which is with the speed of the lightning.</p>

<p>Virginia smiled sweetly at the invalid. &#8220;I am sorry
to intrude,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;but the hospital closes to
visitors in ten minutes; so I had to come now or not
see Joe today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fine of you to come even for a minute.&#8221;
Joe smiled happily and then attempted to present Kelly
and Mr. Jones to her.</p>

<p>She gave them a friendly smile. &#8220;I know you both.
I have seen you in my father&#8217;s office so often that we
are really old acquaintances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly looked her squarely in the eyes and beamed,
&#8220;Thanks, I like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones assumed a manner containing all that
was best from the several books upon social usages
he had perused. Often had he longed for an opportunity
to show the manufacturer&#8217;s daughter that at least
her father&#8217;s private secretary was well versed in such
matters. His chance had come and he must make
the most of it. He bowed profoundly, &#8220;I am honored,
indeed,&#8221; he murmured gently. &#8220;Permit me to express
the extreme pleasure Miss Dale&#8217;s presence gives
me.&#8221; Apparently, at this point, Mr. Jones expected
Virginia to extend her lily white hand to be kissed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>She, being a young thing, a mere chit as it were, was
unversed in this procedure. She looked at the low-bowed
Mr. Jones and then at Joe and Kelly with a
somewhat puzzled expression.</p>

<p>The athletes, being men of vulgar minds, burst into
a roar of laughter which shocked Mr. Jones exceedingly.
Finding nothing better to do, he was forced to
join in amusement at his own expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, I&#8217;m going to miss my supper,&#8221; cried Kelly,
and, with a breezy &#8220;Good bye&#8221; to Virginia and Joe,
and a hurried &#8220;Come on&#8221; to Mr. Jones, he rushed
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones was astounded at this exhibition of haste
and ill-breeding, before this lady of position. However,
he found himself torn between conflicting desires.
He would have gladly spent some hours in the company
of Miss Dale engaged in elegant conversation,
but, at the moment, for the life of him, he could recall
no subject of sufficient gentility for discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Jones,&#8221; came Kelly&#8217;s voice from the
hall.</p>

<p>Virginia had taken Kelly&#8217;s chair and, leaning over
the bed, was engrossed in conversation with the injured
man.</p>

<p>The presence of Mr. Jones was being overlooked.
He deemed it better to depart with Kelly. Immediate
action was essential. He arose and again bowed
deeply. &#8220;Allow me,&#8221; he pleaded, in dulcet tones,
&#8220;to express my delight and joy in meeting Miss Dale
and to inform her that circumstances beyond my individual
control require my withdrawal from her company.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>&#8220;Blow, Jonesy, before your beans get cold,&#8221; suggested
Joe.</p>

<p>At this low remark, Mr. Jones straightened up to his
full height very suddenly and stepped backwards with
dignity. Unhappily, his heel hooked against the leg
of his chair and twisted the piece of furniture beneath
him so that, tripping, he lost his balance upon the
waxed floor. Simultaneously, Mr. Jones lost his dignity
and waved his arms wildly in a frantic endeavor
to recover himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Kelly urged again.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones obeyed the words of his trainer literally.
Coming on over the chair, he landed with a crash
between the beds on the other side of the aisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring the ambulance up here,&#8221; suggested a facetious
patient.</p>

<p>Sore in mind and body, Mr. Jones was assisted to
his feet by the helpful Miss Knight. &#8220;I stumbled,&#8221;
he explained to her in excuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a darn good thing you didn&#8217;t fall,&#8221; replied the
nurse with ill-concealed sarcasm.</p>

<p>Virginia had watched Mr. Jones&#8217;s acrobatic performances
with mixed emotions. She glanced at her
wrist watch and, rising, leaned over to bid Joe farewell.</p>

<p>He caught her hand and held it. For a moment
the black eyes were gazing squarely into the depths
of the blue ones, and no word passed between the
two, yet they were filled with a new, strange joyousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; she whispered gently, and pulled her
hand from Joe&#8217;s as she turned towards the stricken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
Mr. Jones. &#8220;I hope you are not hurt,&#8221; she told him
and left the ward with a nod at Kelly at the door.</p>

<p>Seizing his hat, Mr. Jones limped slowly after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get better control of your muscles after
Mike handles you a bit,&#8221; Joe called after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you fellows that was Charlie Chaplin?&#8221;
came a voice from one of the beds. Amidst
the merriment aroused by this sally Mr. Jones joined
Kelly and took his departure.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN AFTERNOON OFF</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Dis yere fambly ain&#8217; nevah ready to eat. Dey
allers has sumpin else dey gotta do,&#8221; grumbled Serena
as she moved out upon the front porch of the Dale
home.</p>

<p>Virginia stood upon the greensward listening to
the call of a song sparrow in the tree above her head.
The notes of the bird rang clear upon the morning air
in all of their sweetness, until overwhelmed in competition
with a jazz melody whistled by Ike as he moved
about dragging a serpent-like length of hose behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cum in to you&#8217; breakfus, chil&#8217;,&#8221; commanded Serena.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment. Isn&#8217;t it a beautiful day for the
concert?&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Virginia&#8217;s tardiness was yet uppermost
in her mind, Serena deigned to examine the heavens
above and the earth beneath with a critical eye which
proposed to allow no fault to escape it. Then she
made answer in a cryptic reply, &#8220;You ain&#8217; said nothin&#8217;
chil&#8217;, you ain&#8217; said nothin&#8217; a tall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia,&#8221; said Obadiah, when they met at the
breakfast table, &#8220;Mr. Wilkins was here again yesterday
afternoon and you were not at home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>The girl laughed. &#8220;I know it, Daddy,&#8221; she confessed,
as she poured a generous measure of thick
cream over her dish of sliced peaches. The charge of
absenteeism made against her did not appear to be
affecting her appetite as she began to eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I warned you that he was coming,&#8221; Obadiah continued,
impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Daddy.&#8221; The girl was enjoying her peaches
and cream. &#8220;After you told me about it I waited for
him and he didn&#8217;t come,&#8221; she explained virtuously.
&#8220;The next afternoon, I had to go out and&#8211;of course,
he had to come. The afternoon after that, I waited
at home expecting Mr. Wilkins and he never came
near. Yesterday I had to go out&#8211;and he had to
come.&#8221; She laughed gaily. &#8220;We have been playing
a game of hide and seek. Mr. Wilkins has been it and
hasn&#8217;t caught me yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been an expensive game for me,&#8221; protested
Obadiah. &#8220;I pay Mr. Wilkins a large salary for his
time and services and I can use them to better advantage
than in making calls upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an ungallant speech. I am filled with shame
for my own father.&#8221; She shook her head sadly in
token of her disgrace. &#8220;If Mr. Wilkins wants to see
me, why doesn&#8217;t he arrange to come when I am home?&#8221;
she argued stoutly.</p>

<p>Obadiah became stern. &#8220;You should have remained
home for Mr. Wilkins. You are out a great deal,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of mock horror came into Virginia&#8217;s face.
&#8220;Would you have me sit alone in this big house, waiting
with folded arms for Mr. Wilkins?&#8221; she giggled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>Even Obadiah relented before this sorrowful picture.
&#8220;Who said anything about folded arms,&#8221; he
demanded shortly, &#8220;or about sitting alone, either?
You are out some place in that machine every day.
It won&#8217;t hurt you to remain at home until Mr. Wilkins
has seen you. My affairs are of more importance
than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia looked at him with great solemnity. &#8220;You
want to be cross at me, Daddy, and you can&#8217;t make
yourself,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;These peaches and cream
are protecting me. If they didn&#8217;t taste so good to you,
I would get a scolding. I don&#8217;t deserve it, though,
because, after all, my affairs are always your affairs.
Ike says that the machine runs better if it is used every
day. I keep it in splendid order for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The efforts of his daughter did not appear to impress
Obadiah.</p>

<p>She went on with an air of pride, &#8220;Lately, I have
been busy on a surprise for you.&#8221; She assumed an air
of dignity. &#8220;I am giving an entertainment to the
old ladies of the Lucinda Home this afternoon. I
planned it all by myself and I invite you to be present.
There&#8217;ll be a concert by a brass band. Aren&#8217;t
you surprised, Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah was surprised. Without reference to
natural perplexity as to why festivities for the benefit
of the old ladies should be a matter of astonishment to
him, there were ample grounds for amazement in the
knowledge that his youthful daughter had assumed
management of a production involving a brass band.
It was as if she had announced her connection with
a circus for the aged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;Where did you get the band?&#8221; demanded Obadiah,
in the tone of an anxious parent whose infant has returned
bearing personal property suspected of belonging
to a neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Ryan loaned it to me. He is coming, too.
Won&#8217;t you come, Daddy dear, please?&#8221; There was
a wistful look in the girl&#8217;s face. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be
lovely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah was uncomfortable. &#8220;I can&#8217;t come today,&#8221;
he replied, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Daddy&#8211;&#8221; her disappointment showed in every
note of her voice&#8211;&#8220;I have counted so much on having
you. I would be so proud of you.&#8221; She glanced
imploringly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out of town,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you put it off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Virginia, I have made my plans to go today.
I can&#8217;t let anything interfere with business arrangements.
They mean dollars and cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Daddy,&#8221; she surrendered with a sad
little sigh and tried to cheer herself. &#8220;Some day
when I have something else you&#8217;ll plan to come, won&#8217;t
you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interested in his newspaper now. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221;
he finally answered absently without looking
up.</p>

<p>For a time they ate in silence. &#8220;The afternoon
frightens me, Daddy,&#8221; she told him with a worried
air. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big responsibility. What if it should be
a failure?&#8221;</p>

<p>He crushed his paper down by his plate and snapped,
&#8220;You got into the thing of your own accord. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
up to you to see it through. To make a success of it&#8211;a
Dale success. You can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His assurance braced the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make a go of
it, Daddy,&#8221; she promised, and then, &#8220;It&#8217;s wrong for
me to expect Mr. Wilkins to run after me. I will go
to his office this morning and see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her a look of approval. &#8220;That&#8217;s business,&#8221;
he agreed.</p>

<p>She hovered about him after they rose from the
table. &#8220;Could I ask Mr. Wilkins to come to my
concert, Daddy?&#8221; There was an appealing look in
the big blue eyes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it to seem as if I
have no friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her an uneasy glance and there was almost
a note of regret in his voice when he answered, &#8220;I am
sorry that I can&#8217;t come. Certainly, you may ask Mr.
Wilkins. Tell him that I want him to go. Ask any
one you like.&#8221; Yet in spite of these concessions his
conscience disturbed him. &#8220;How will you meet the
expenses of the entertainment,&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be much. Serena had the things which
I needed charged at the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah appeared about to protest but changed his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can pay for anything else I need out of my allowance,&#8221;
she went on.</p>

<p>An unusual wave of generosity engulfed Obadiah,
due, no doubt, to pricks of his unquiet conscience.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;Send the bills to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A delighted Virginia lifted up her voice, joyously,
&#8220;How perfectly grand! I&#8217;ll order ice cream for everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>Pain rested upon Obadiah&#8217;s countenance, due, no
doubt, rather to a twinge of indigestion at the mention
of a large quantity of ice cream during the breakfast
hour than to regret at the result of his unusual liberality.
He sought relief in reproving Ike sternly, ere
departing for his office.</p>

<p>Virginia spent a busy morning. She telephoned to
Colonel Ryan, visited Mrs. Henderson and conferred
at length with Mrs. Smith, the matron at the Lucinda
Home, regarding the approaching festivities.</p>

<p>Later, she repaired to the establishment of Mr.
Vivian, glittering brilliantly in the morning sun and
graced even at this early hour by thirsty members of
South Ridgefield&#8217;s younger set.</p>

<p>Her deliberations with the genial proprietor were
prolonged. Complex factors hindered the meeting of
minds regarded as essential to the contractual relationship
of commerce. Mr. Vivian&#8217;s knowledge of
the law of probabilities as applied to the consumption
of ice cream and cake by infants, by adults, or by infants
and adults together, was as deep as the information
of an insurance actuary on the mortality of fellow
men. But specialists gain their reputation through
years of toil, and they object to risking it on the uncertain.
To Mr. Vivian the capacity of old ladies and
aged soldiers for delicate confections was an unknown
factor. He had no digest of leading cases to consult,
no vital statistics to inspect, no medical journals to
study. He was venturing into unexplored territory.
Without premises he was asked to deduct a conclusion.
Mr. Vivian was reduced to an unscientific guess.</p>

<p>Yet, if necessary, guesses can be made. So it came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
to pass that Mr. Vivian bowed the manufacturer&#8217;s
daughter from his emporium, and, with the sweet smell
of his wares in his nostrils, raised eyes of loving kindness
from the profitable order in his hand, due account
thereof to be rendered unto Obadiah for payment, and
gazed after her in respectful admiration.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the judicial solemnity of the
chamber of Hezekiah Wilkins, Attorney at Law, situate
and being, opposite the suite of Obadiah, was disturbed
by a timid knock. It failed to attract Hezekiah&#8217;s
attention. This was strange. The room was
not unusually large. Also, its size was diminished by
cases of reports, digests and encyclopedias covering
the walls, except where they were pierced by the windows
and door or broken by the fireplace and its broad
chimney face. Upon this hung a picture of the Supreme
Court and on the mantel below stood a bust of
John Marshall, the stern eyes of which viewed the
polished back of Hezekiah&#8217;s head as he sat at his desk.</p>

<p>It is possible that the lawyer was preoccupied through
profound consideration of some abstract point of law.
Before him lay an open court report and his desk was
littered with documents. His head was bowed forward,
his hands clasped over his abdomen and his eyes
closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tap&#8211;tap,&#8221; sounded again at the door. Hezekiah
brushed at his face as if to shoo a disturbing fly. Yet,
so deep were his meditations that he failed to note the
interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knock&#8211;knock&#8211;bang.&#8221; The noise swelled to
a well-defined blow of sufficient authority to recall the
greatest mental concentration from the most tortuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
legal labyrinth of the most learned court in the world.</p>

<p>Hezekiah jumped. He raised his head with a jerk
and his eyes opened. One unacquainted with the
abysmal excogitations of judicial mentalities might describe
them as having a startled look. He rubbed them
with his fists, stroked his smooth shaven cheeks and replaced
his glasses on his nose. Having by such simple
expedients withdrawn his mind from the fathomless
depths of legal lore into which it seemingly had
been plunged, he shouted, &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia entered.</p>

<p>Hezekiah, recognizing the daughter of his employer,
sprang to his feet, greeting her, &#8220;I am honored, indeed,
Miss Dale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wilkins, my father says that I have done
wrong in allowing you to come to our house twice and
not find me at home.&#8221; She smiled sweetly at him as
she held out her hand to him. &#8220;I am sorry. I
thought that my best apology would be to save you
another trip by coming to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very considerate, Miss Dale,&#8221; he responded,
as he offered her his visitor&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>She sat down filled with great curiosity as to his
business with her.</p>

<p>He did not approach it directly. &#8220;We are having
beautiful weather, Miss Dale. Being given to out of
door pursuits and pastimes&#8211;athletic, as it were&#8211;you
must find it very agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do enjoy these beautiful spring days. I like to
be out of doors, too. But I am not what they call an
athletic girl, Mr. Wilkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I plead guilty to an inaccuracy of nomenclature,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
Hezekiah responded with great solemnity, removing
his glasses and flourishing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say, Mr. Wilkins?&#8221; asked Virginia
in smiling bewilderment.</p>

<p>His eyes began to twinkle and in spite of his serious
face she caught his mood and they burst into a peal
of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Dale&#8211;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>She interrupted him. &#8220;Call me Virginia as you
always have done, Mr. Wilkins,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;Please
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be easier,&#8221; he admitted, and then for a moment
he studied her face thoughtfully. &#8220;You are
looking more like your mother, every day, Virginia.
She was a beautiful woman&#8211;a very beautiful
woman,&#8221; he continued dreamily. &#8220;As good, too, as
she was beautiful. It seems to me, now, that her life
was given up to doing kindnesses to others. I have
always been proud that your mother accepted me as
one of her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words awakened eager interest in the girl.
&#8220;Tell me about her, please, Mr. Wilkins,&#8221; she begged,
as he paused.</p>

<p>He smiled gently into the wistful eyes of blue, as
happy remembrances of the past returned to him.
&#8220;Your mother came into our lives as a gentle zephyr
from her own beautiful Southland. With her came
memories of bright sunshine, growing flowers and perfumed
air. These things radiated from her&#8211;a part
of her life. Happiness and joy were ever her constant
companions and the gifts she would shower.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s eyes were big with the tender longings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
of her heart. &#8220;My mother tried to make every one
else happy, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>The countenance of Hezekiah softened and his voice
was tempered by gentle memories as he said, &#8220;If she
tried to do that, she succeeded. Every one who knew
your mother was the happier for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;what a beautiful thing to say about her,
Mr. Wilkins,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>After a few moments of silence, Hezekiah resolutely
thrust aside the reveries into which he and his visitor
had plunged. &#8220;Ahem,&#8221; he coughed and then he polished
his scalp so vigorously that it became suffused
with a purplish tinge. &#8220;Virginia,&#8221; he inquired sternly,
&#8220;are you acquainted with one Joseph Tolliver Curtis?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant Virginia was unable to identify Joe
under his formal appellation. &#8220;Yes, he is the man
at the hospital who was hurt by our machine,&#8221; she
answered finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have visited him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He removed his glasses and tapped his teeth. &#8220;Did
you ever discuss with the said Joseph Tolliver Curtis
the accident heretofore referred to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say, Mr. Wilkins?&#8221; worried Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please state,&#8221; demanded Hezekiah absently,
&#8220;whether at any time or any place you discussed
the subject matter of this action with the plaintiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wilkins, what are you talking about?&#8221; Virginia
cried in dismay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>Hezekiah came out of his preoccupation. &#8220;I beg
your pardon,&#8221; he said hastily. &#8220;I asked if you ever
talked over the accident with Curtis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the question you asked me, Mr. Wilkins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest,&#8221; he chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can answer that easily. I talked it all over
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you objection to advising me of the substance&#8211;&#8221;
Hezekiah stopped and restated his question&#8211;&#8220;Will
you tell what you said, Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I told Mr. Curtis that I was to blame for
the accident and he said it was his own fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer was surprised. &#8220;Did he admit negligence?&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia deemed this question to imply danger to
Joe and she remembered her promise. &#8220;I am not at
liberty to say, Mr. Wilkins,&#8221; she answered stoutly.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t discuss Mr. Curtis&#8217;s part in the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Hezekiah eyed the girl thoughtfully.
He arose and took a turn up and down the room while
his eyes danced with mischief. He reached a decision
which changed his line of questioning when he reseated
himself. &#8220;Virginia, do you think that you
were to blame for that accident?&#8221; he asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were a witness in court, would you testify
that the accident was your fault?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would admit my blame anywhere and any place,
Mr. Wilkins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Curtis say anything to you about bringing
a suit for damages against your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he wouldn&#8217;t do that, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>&#8220;Why are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him that I believed my father should pay
him damages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say to that?&#8221; asked Hezekiah with
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said that he wouldn&#8217;t take money from my
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he angry, Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no indeed.&#8221; She hesitated for a moment.
&#8220;He seemed tired and worn out and so I left
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Virginia, what would you say if I told you
that I tried to reach an agreement with Mr. Curtis the
other day and he refused to accept anything in settlement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say that my father is just the dearest and noblest
man that ever lived. He sent you to do that, didn&#8217;t
he, Mr. Wilkins, and never said a word about it to me?
Isn&#8217;t that just like Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah smiled but said no word. Possibly he remembered
the amount of the check. Professional confidences
make lawyers cynical. He drummed a spirited
march upon his desk with his fingers and took no
other part in the acclaim of Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wilkins,&#8221; worried Virginia, &#8220;do you suppose
that you could have hurt Mr. Curtis&#8217;s feelings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not intend to. Men are never as gentle as
women, though.&#8221; Hezekiah was playing a foxy game.
&#8220;A man is rougher. It is easy for him to hurt the
feelings of a sensitive person without having the slightest
intention of doing so.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/illus1.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;<span class='sc'>This request appeared to require deep thought</span>&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>Virginia gave serious regard to memories of a pair
of black eyes. &#8220;I think Joe Curtis is very sensitive,&#8221;
she said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; agreed the crafty Hezekiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind, Mr. Wilkins&#8211;&#8221; she gave the
lawyer an appealing glance after some moments of consideration&#8211;&#8220;if
I talked with Mr. Curtis about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>This request appeared to require deep thought, judging
from the seriousness of Hezekiah&#8217;s face for a few
moments. Then it lightened as he decided, &#8220;I can see
no objection to your talking to Mr. Curtis.&#8221; The attorney&#8217;s
manner became cheery and hopeful. &#8220;Now,
if you two could arrive at a friendly settlement, it
might be a most satisfactory arrangement.&#8221; Hezekiah
slapped his palms together and squeezed his own fingers
as if shaking hands with himself at the successful
outcome of his benevolent moves. Then he chuckled
softly and went on, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what kind of an adjustment
you two youngsters can make. If I can
approve it, I will be glad to submit it to your
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see him as soon as I can, Mr. Wilkins. I
can&#8217;t go to the hospital this afternoon.&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s
manner became very dignified, as she continued, &#8220;I
am giving a concert, at the Lucinda Home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delightful.&#8221; Hezekiah bowed low at the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see Mr. Curtis in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be quite time enough. Don&#8217;t inconvenience
yourself, Virginia.&#8221; Hezekiah smiled as they
arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wilkins, won&#8217;t you come to my concert?&#8221;
asked Virginia, shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a pleasure, indeed, but, business first,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
you know.&#8221; He waved his hands, palms upward, as if
protesting the lowness of his profit.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father said that I might tell you that he would
be glad if you could arrange to come. He is out of
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, in that case&#8211;&#8221; Hezekiah&#8217;s manner was
courtly&#8211;&#8220;I deem myself highly privileged in accepting
your invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Virginia left Hezekiah&#8217;s office, she found herself
facing the open door of her father&#8217;s suite. Through
it Mr. Jones was visible at his desk, improving his mind
in Obadiah&#8217;s absence by reading a refined story by a
polished author concerning genteel people. Mr. Jones
needed physical rest and mental recreation. Upon the
previous evening, Mike Kelly had seized his person and
regardless of vigorous protests had put him through
such a series of calisthenics, runnings, jumpings and
rubbings that the particular soreness of each bone and
muscle had merged into one great and common ache.</p>

<p>At the opening of Hezekiah&#8217;s door, Mr. Jones raised
his eyes and, consequently, his head. A wave of pain
swept his muscles. He grimaced frightfully. It was
upon this distorted countenance that Virginia gazed.
The terrifying effect of the face held the girl for a
second, but believing it occasioned by grievous illness
she hastened to the aid of the stricken one.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones instantly recognized her and the course of
destiny was made manifest. Regardless of untoward
events, his social merit was appreciated and now one
approached seeking counsel or bearing invitations to
social festivities. She should not seek in vain. Percy
Jones, private secretary and social adviser, was at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
service. He sprang from his chair to meet the maid
of blood with knightly bow and courtly grace. Alack
and aday, that snare of the devil, his waste basket, was
misplaced. He tripped against it. To avoid the thing,
he raised his foot only to step into the throat-like neck
of the monster which instantly clove to his shoe.
Simultaneously, a flood of pain protested against his
violent movements. In his agony, Mr. Jones lost his
balance and fell over his desk. His outstretched hands
sought safe anchorage amidst ink stands and mucilage
bottles to rest finally in an ever spreading lake of ink.</p>

<p>Virginia halted. Mr. Jones&#8217;s face, rent by emotion
and struggle, convinced her that he must be in parlous
case.</p>

<p>Kelly hurried in at the crash. He observed Mr.
Jones&#8217;s predicament with great calmness. Nodding to
Virginia, he held the basket until the stenographer
could extract his foot. Then he turned to the girl and
said very soberly, in spite of the glint of amusement
in his eye, &#8220;Mr. Jones is the victim of an accident and
requests permission to retire and cleanse himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the crestfallen private secretary departed, Kelly
and Virginia moved over to a window. The summer
day in all of its beauty fought back the ugliness of
the tin roofs and chimneys. The bookkeeper viewed
the prospect. &#8220;By gum,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;how&#8217;d you like
to go snowshoeing?&#8221; This marvelous witticism was
greeted by a burst of laughing applause from its author
and the girl, far in excess of its merit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jones doesn&#8217;t feel very well today,&#8221; Kelly explained
to her. &#8220;He is the victim of unusual exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look like a man who would over-exercise.
He does not strike me as a man who is in the
best of health,&#8221; she responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s so stiff and sore after
a few little stunts. He doesn&#8217;t get enough fresh air.&#8221;
Kelly cast a longing glance out of the window and
turned to inspect the room. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough fresh
air in this place, anyway. Jones has sat in here day
after day, sucking on cigarettes and beating on that
typewriter, until good health no longer knows him.
But,&#8221; announced the bookkeeper with great confidence,
&#8220;I am old Doctor Fix&#8217;em. I&#8217;m giving him a course
in physical training which will fix him. I&#8217;m going to
make that lad forget his present pains by giving him
worse ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is perfectly fine of you, Mr. Kelly, to
help Mr. Jones,&#8221; exclaimed Virginia, highly interested
in the bookkeeper&#8217;s plans for the benefit of the stenographer.
&#8220;It must make you very happy to be able
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I laugh myself sick every
time I give him a new stunt to do. That fellow has
good points. One of these days he&#8217;s going to have the
smile on some one else. You can&#8217;t keep a good man
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I help Mr. Jones, too?&#8221; asked the girl
eagerly.</p>

<p>Kelly stared at her in amazement. &#8220;No, it can&#8217;t
be done,&#8221; he cried, emphatically. &#8220;Whoever heard of
a woman trainer? You&#8217;ve had no experience anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia blushed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to help train
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
him.&#8221; She waxed indignant at the thought. &#8220;I only
offered to do those things which I could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;&#8221; Kelly was relieved&#8211;&#8220;go as far as you
like. There is plenty of chance for all on that fellow.
It would be dandy if you could work it to get him
out of doors once in awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch me,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones reentered the room physically clean and
mentally chastened but deep in gloom. He had forgotten
that the darkest hour comes just before dawn.
Yet, a private secretary must not allow his personal
feelings to interfere with duty. He approached Virginia
in what might be described as a graceful manner
marred by lameness. &#8220;I regret the unfortunate occurrence
which delayed me,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;If Miss
Dale wishes to see her father&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A pair of blue eyes rested upon him in the kindest
manner and a most attractive mouth said, &#8220;I know
that my father is away today and that neither of you
has much to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s official staff looked guilty.</p>

<p>Virginia went on with enthusiasm. &#8220;We are going
to give a concert this afternoon for the old ladies at the
Lucinda Home. It will be lovely. A brass band&#8211;ice
cream&#8211;Mr. Wilkins&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The high interest of the young man cooled slightly
at the lawyer&#8217;s name, regardless of the pleasing company
in which he was mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you both come? You could help me so
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get off,&#8221; declared the practical Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can. My father said that I could invite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
whom I pleased.&#8221; She turned pleadingly to Mr. Jones.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll come and bring Mr. Kelly, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The victim of disaster was as one hypnotized by the
charm of her presence. Before the wiles of women,
his gallant soul became as putty. Mr. Jones stammered,
he stuttered, he blushed&#8211;and from his lips
came the whispered answer, &#8220;Yes, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>OLD HEARTS MADE YOUNG</span></h2>

<p>Nature left nothing to be desired in the weather
as the hour approached for the concert at the Lucinda
Home. Over the closely shaven lawn and beneath the
shade of the trees lay the tranquillity of a summer&#8217;s
afternoon.</p>

<p>This was disturbed, shortly after lunch, by the roaring
of the Dale car as it rushed up the curving driveway
to the main building. It was driven by Ike, and
Serena sat beside him in the purity of apparel, freshly
laundered and starched.</p>

<p>But, even at this hour, the aged ladies had retired to
their apartments to make ready for the gaieties of the
late afternoon.</p>

<p>The coming of the Dale car was the beginning of a
series of commotions in this haven of peace. A big
army truck arrived with a noise of thunder bringing
trestles and plank for a temporary band stand. It
stopped, and through the balmy silence sounded a
rough, coarse, masculine voice, &#8220;Where in the devil
do they want this blame thing?&#8221; Answered his companion,
&#8220;You can search me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A window closed with a crash to shut out contamination
from such vulgar sources.</p>

<p>As the army truck and its crew noisily departed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
another machine entered the grounds. It was a quiet car,
not given to loud or uncouth uproar. Stealing up the
driveway, it stopped. Mr. Vivian emerged, garbed in
spotless white. Other soft stepping, mild mannered
men, similarly clothed, accompanied him, bearing
freezers of cream and boxes of cake.</p>

<p>Serena entered into conference with the caterer.
&#8220;Des ole ladies dey wants der tea mo&#8217;e den yo&#8217;alls
sweet stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian appeared pained at such taste.</p>

<p>Serena went on, &#8220;Ah&#8217;s gwine mek de tea in de
kitchen an&#8217; surve it an&#8217; de sandwiches outen de side
do&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disgust sat upon Mr. Vivian&#8217;s features. &#8220;I shall
serve the cream from under the trees, in the cool fresh
air,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gwine surve it full o&#8217; bugs an&#8217; flies den,&#8221;
predicted Serena.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian, through the exercise of self-control,
stood mute.</p>

<p>Serena sought information. &#8220;Who gwine surve ma
tea an&#8217; ma sandwiches?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian whistled a few measures of melody,
softly. Being thus engaged, he could not respond.</p>

<p>Serena pressed for an answer. &#8220;Ain&#8217; yo&#8217;all do
dat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly my men may assist you,&#8221; the caterer conceded,
as he glanced at his assistants grouped at his
back.</p>

<p>Serena was supported by Ike and several colored females,
employees of the Home, into whose good graces
the chauffeur was endeavoring to ingratiate himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>The situation was tense.</p>

<p>Serena&#8217;s hands were upon her hips and her entire
body vibrated. Her eyes glistened with rage and
rested menacingly upon the caterer. She was clothed
in an air of mystery. Her opponent could not determine
whether she proposed to rely upon logical argument,
abusive language, or physical violence.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian noted uneasily the mass of vibrant temper
he had aroused. He stood his ground, however,
and did not retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoall is er givin&#8217; dis yere sociable? Whoall
pays fo&#8217; dis yere &#8217;tainment? Ah asts you dat? Answer
me, whiteman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike drew nigh, inclining an ear that he might miss
no word of the altercation. &#8220;Dats right,&#8221; he interjected
in a rich mellow voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian gave no heed to the aid and comfort
vouchsafed his adversary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah tells you who pays. Ah&#8217;m right yere to tell
yo&#8217;all who pays,&#8221; proclaimed Serena. &#8220;Miss Virginy
done pay. Dat who.&#8221; Hers was a song of triumph
now. &#8220;Ahs her nu&#8217;se. Ah&#8217;s her housekeeper.&#8221;
She shook a great fist at the caterer. &#8220;Whiteman,
wot ah sez, ah means. Ef yo&#8217;all ain&#8217; gwine surve ma
sandwiches an&#8217; ma tea, jes tek yo&#8217;se&#8217;f an&#8217; des yere white
waiters away f&#8217;om yere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s right,&#8221; concurred Ike, confident that he appeared
to good advantage before the employees of the
Home and that, through his stalwart support of Serena,
he was laying up treasure for a rainy day.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this talk about?&#8221; Mr. Vivian demanded
suddenly as if being a stranger to the controversy he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
sought enlightenment. &#8220;Who said that I wouldn&#8217;t
serve your sandwiches and tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Serena, after the manner of her generation, was
wise. She understood the whiteman and knew when
to stop war and resort to diplomacy. She whirled
upon the hapless Ike. &#8220;Ain&#8217; yo&#8217;all got no bettah manners
an&#8217; to stan&#8217; der er listin&#8217; at dis gent&#8217;men an&#8217; me
a talkin&#8217;. You &#8217;minds me o&#8217; er ole turkey gobbler er
standin der wid you&#8217; haid twisted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an unlooked-for attack, from one with whom
he had publicly allied himself, grieved Ike sorely. He
retreated crestfallen and humiliated.</p>

<p>When Virginia entered the kitchen she found Serena
and Mr. Vivian laboring diligently and as intimate
friends, decrying the efficiency of their assistants without
regard to color or previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p>Another army truck brought the band. White collars
and ties showed festively above brass buttoned blue
coats. Hair, mustaches, and whiskers had been
dressed with extraordinary care, and aged musicians
looked from beneath campaign hats worn at a most
rakish angle. As they took possession of the stand,
there ensued a period of melancholy tootings as instruments
were adjusted and lips made supple.</p>

<p>Excitement seized the old ladies at their toilets, as
these isolated blarings smote their ears. Certain partially
deaf ones, confident that the concert had begun
and desirous of missing no note of it, descended, minus
switches, false fronts and, indeed, in one case, an over-skirt.
These omissions became the subject of great
embarrassment when discovered later.</p>

<p>As three o&#8217;clock approached, a prim calmness fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
upon the inmates of the home when they assembled
stiffly gowned in best apparel.</p>

<p>Hezekiah Wilkins, in holiday garb of silk hat and
cutaway frock, arrived. Mrs. Henderson came a few
moments later. Certain uninvited ancient men dressed
as for a fiesta followed. Mr. Jones and Kelly entered
the grounds with an air of having casually dropped in
and not intending to stay long. The stenographer
wore a natty suit, the check of which caught the discriminating
eye of Ike as it rounded the gate. At the
scheduled moment for the concert, Colonel Ryan approached
and, after saluting Virginia, seated himself
upon the porch and viewed the band with the pride and
pleasure of its proprietor.</p>

<p>At the tap of the leader, the onlookers were dazzled
by golden reflections as the musicians lifted their instruments.
With a burst of harmony, Virginia&#8217;s concert
was on. Even at the first note, the stiff dignity
of the audience melted and they conversed. Women
whose taciturnity had been remarked for years in that
place of silence became loquacious.</p>

<p>The concert made an attractive picture. The band
was upon the lawn in front of the building. On the
lower porch and in shady places about the grounds
were groups of aged women. Their white hair
blended softly with the dresses of grey and black, and
soft fichus or treasured bits of lace were drawn about
wrinkled necks by cameos and big brooches.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkins conducted Mrs. Henderson to several
spots from which to hear the music. They were rejected
summarily by the fastidious widow on the
grounds of ants below or spiders above and the general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
presence of bugs. Finally she made her own selection,
confessing a suspicion of the presence in concealment
of grasshoppers and the fear that the place was attractive
to frogs and grass snakes.</p>

<p>Perceiving Hezekiah&#8217;s holiday attire and Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s
manner, Mr. Vivian deemed them important
personages and served them bountifully with his own
hands. He was rewarded by hearing the widow tell
her escort, &#8220;You can&#8217;t buy decent ice cream in South
Ridgefield. It&#8217;s all adulterated and unfit for human
consumption. The people who make such stuff should
be put in jail for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah chuckled contentedly. &#8220;Why not chop
off their heads?&#8221; he suggested kindly.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian departed hastily.</p>

<p>From their position they could see Virginia moving
busily about from group to group.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson indicated her. &#8220;There is a dear
girl,&#8221; she said fondly. &#8220;It&#8217;s Elinor Dale come back
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia is very like her mother,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did Elinor ever marry a man like Obadiah?&#8221;
she sighed.</p>

<p>Hezekiah liked sandwiches. Particularly lettuce
sandwiches with mayonnaise dressing. Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s
question caught him unawares. &#8220;Wanted to,&#8221;
he mumbled through his mouthful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hezekiah Wilkins, an answer of that sort kills conversation.
You give me a sociable reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>The muffling sandwiches had been gotten rid of.
&#8220;Fascinated,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fascinated by a serpent,&#8221; sniffed Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>The inference that Obadiah was a reptile failed to
effect the appetite of his legal adviser. He appropriated
another sandwich.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you work for him, anyway?&#8221; she demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money,&#8221; confessed Hezekiah, between bites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hezekiah, there is something about your conversation
which irritates me. I think that its brevity gets
on my nerves.&#8221; She gave him a questioning look.
&#8220;I want to talk seriously with an old friend, Hezekiah.
I want to ask him to do something for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped eating and turned towards her. The
humor had faded from his face and in its place was a
certain sweetness with much of sorrow in it. &#8220;Over
twenty years ago, you asked me to be a brother to you,
Mary,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;I have always tried to be a
good one&#8211;to be ready to obey your slightest wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was pain and pity in her countenance as she
reached over and patted his hand. &#8220;I know it, Hezekiah,&#8221;
she whispered. &#8220;You have been too good a
brother to me. You should have married.&#8221; There
was a catch in her voice and her eyes were moist, when
she continued, &#8220;I never intended to condemn you to
a life of loneliness when I married Tom Henderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>His thoughts flew back over the long years. &#8220;It
has been lonely, Mary,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;Are you sorry
that I could not forget?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered, winking back her tears. &#8220;It
has been a beautiful tribute&#8211;too beautiful for me.
I was never worthy of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the better judge of that,&#8221; he murmured
quietly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>For a time they were lost in the dreams of what
might have been, when they were disturbed by the big
booming laugh of Colonel Ryan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hezekiah Wilkins,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Henderson
with some sharpness, &#8220;we are a pair of sentimental
old fools to dig up the past. We should save our
strength for the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Implying that we might better be preparing to dig
our own graves. Is that your idea?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Indignant eyes in which but little sentiment lingered,
rested upon the lawyer. &#8220;I suppose that you wished
to be amusing, Hezekiah, but for a man noted for his
tact that was an inexcusably gruesome speech. We
may be old, as you intimate,&#8221; she snapped, &#8220;but we
have work to do before&#8211;we get busy on our own
graves.&#8221; Her gaze traveled across the lawn and came
to rest upon the girlish figure of Virginia standing beside
the Colonel. Hennie&#8217;s mood softened, and when
she spoke, it was as if she were thinking aloud. &#8220;If
we have met sorrow and disillusionment in our own
lives, Hezekiah, and with smiling lips have swallowed
the bitter mouthful, should we not be willing to keep
those whom we love from a similar experience?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah bowed in sober agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia Dale is very happy this afternoon,&#8221; Mrs.
Henderson went on, &#8220;because she is doing what her
mother, Elinor, always loved to do&#8211;make others
happy. It has never entered her head that her father
is not generous and kind&#8211;that he is the mean and
selfish man that you and I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow reached over and laid her hand upon
that of the lawyer. &#8220;I am going to tell you a story,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
Hezekiah. It is about those good old days when you
and I used to dance and do other gay and frivolous
things&#8211;before we laid ourselves on the shelf.&#8221; Her
face saddened. &#8220;My story is mostly a guess,&#8221; she
continued, &#8220;and it is about what I think happened
to Elinor Dale in those long bedridden hours before
she died.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, he bowed and he was saddened, too, by the
memories she recalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my guess, Hezekiah,&#8221; she resumed, &#8220;that before
Elinor Dale died, the scales fell from her eyes and
she knew the true Obadiah.&#8221; Mrs. Henderson sighed.
&#8220;Poor Elinor knew that she had to go. Too loyal
to confide in any one, she wanted to fight his selfish influence
over her baby girl after she had gone. Let me
tell you what she did&#8211;the poor weapon she was
forced to resort to, Hezekiah.&#8221; The widow shook her
head sorrowfully. &#8220;Elinor marked a poem in a book
and pledged me to give it to Virginia on her eighteenth
birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon is one of the first fruits of the
seed poor Elinor sowed years ago. Her daughter has
grown, thanks to poor Serena&#8217;s efforts&#8211;they ought
to be successful because I don&#8217;t believe that old negro
ever bought the child a hat without taking it up in her
prayers&#8211;into a beautiful woman. Fertile soil for
the crop her mother would harvest, but&#8211;&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
paused and her eyes flashed&#8211;&#8220;there is that
Obadiah. Only the kindness of fate has kept Virginia
from understanding him. When she does there will
be a day of reckoning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson leaned towards Hezekiah and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
looked into his eyes with her own overflowing with a
great tenderness. &#8220;My faithful brother,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;when that day comes won&#8217;t you do your part
in keeping that sweet girl happy even as she is trying
to do it for these old ladies? In your way you can
do more than I can, Hezekiah. Won&#8217;t you do it for
Elinor?&#8221; She hesitated for a moment and continued,
very softly, very gently, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you do it for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned Hennie&#8217;s look, his face alight with tenderness.
&#8220;I will, Mary,&#8221; he promised.</p>

<p>The activities of Mr. Jones at this period were interesting.
Regardless of his aches and pains, he
deemed it his duty, as Obadiah&#8217;s private secretary, to
assume an active part in making the entertainment a
success. With this in mind, he had volunteered his
services to Virginia. Rewarding him with a sweet
smile, she had sent him for a cup of tea. Mr. Jones
performed this errand with great expedition and dispatch,
thereby winning the gratitude of an aged tea
drinker. Virginia being busy, Mr. Jones determined
to exhibit his zeal in so signal a manner that it might
not be overlooked. Returning to the kitchen, he seized
a tray of edibles and, bearing it forth, began to distribute
its contents with great energy.</p>

<p>Instantly, excitement seized the white coated waiters.
They laid aside their trays and conferred. Soon,
above the music, even above conversation, the notes
of a whistle sounded. It was not the piercing call of
a policeman or of a referee, it was not the pipe of a
boatswain, it was rather the low, mourning call of a
dove. As it smote the ears of Mr. Vivian he became
as one transfixed with horror. He became ghastly pale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
as he recognized that the earnest efforts of Mr. Jones
alone stood between the guests and famine.</p>

<p>Recovering himself, the caterer hurried towards his
assembled employees. From his manner it appeared
he hoped for the best but suspected the worst.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter here?&#8221; he demanded in low, tense
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have struck,&#8221; murmured the waiters.</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian&#8217;s worst expectations were confirmed.
&#8220;Why?&#8221; he inquired, with the usual interest of employers
under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>The strikers turned and pointed at the form of Mr.
Jones as he distributed a tray of viands with such
marvelous rapidity that the effect of the walkout was
as yet unnoticed by the aged. &#8220;Scab,&#8221; they hissed in
hostile sibilation. &#8220;Strikebreaker,&#8221; they groaned, impressed
by the wonderful dexterity of the stenographer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did that bird come from?&#8221; demanded the
amazed Mr. Vivian as he viewed the skill of the gratuitous
laborer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; taunted an irate waiter; but Mr.
Vivian&#8217;s honest countenance gave him the lie in his
teeth, noiselessly.</p>

<p>Curiosity held the little group. They examined Mr.
Jones&#8217;s work with professional interest, making surmises
as to his identity. &#8220;Looks like a jockey,&#8221; said
one. &#8220;More like a barber,&#8221; urged another. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet
ten cents he is an ex-bartender,&#8221; wagered a sportive
character.</p>

<p>Even as they watched, Mr. Jones approached Virginia,
offering her food with profound bows and
courtly manners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>&#8220;He is a waiter,&#8221; declared the strikers with one accord,
and again they rested suspicious eyes upon Mr.
Vivian.</p>

<p>&#8220;That dub ain&#8217;t working for me,&#8221; affirmed the caterer.</p>

<p>Much elated at successfully allaying famine, Mr.
Jones turned anew towards the kitchen. Had not Virginia
smiled upon him? He swung his tray and
whistled a merry tune. In the pleasure of serving
others, the aches and pains of the athlete were forgotten.
At the kitchen door he was surrounded by resolute
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make no resistance,&#8221; a determined voice warned.</p>

<p>The white coated mob moved away escorting Mr.
Jones as towards summary execution.</p>

<p>Scenting happenings of interest, Ike followed.</p>

<p>From the kitchen Serena sought information.
&#8220;Whar yo&#8217;all gwine?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey done struck. Yah&#8211;yah&#8211;yah,&#8221; laughed
Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut you&#8217; big mouf. Ah ain&#8217; er astin&#8217; you nothin&#8217;.&#8221;
Serena reproved the chauffeur and then she
charged into the midst of the mob. &#8220;Wot yo&#8217;all mean
a leavin&#8217; ma trays an&#8217; dirty dishes out in dat ya&#8217;d?
Ain&#8217; you know how to wait?&#8221; Her eyes flashed her
indignation. &#8220;Go git ma dishes an&#8217; ma trays afo&#8217;e
ah meks you move fas&#8217;er den you lak.&#8221;</p>

<p>As snow before an April sun the strike melted. The
waiters departed hastily for their field of duty, leaving
Mr. Jones alone with Serena. She glared at him
fiercely. &#8220;How cum you mek ma waiters mad?&#8221; she
demanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>Amazed at the strange results of his diligence, Mr.
Jones stood silent under her accusation.</p>

<p>She inspected his slight figure contemptuously.
&#8220;Clea&#8217; out,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;afo ah lays ma han&#8217;
on you an&#8217; breks you, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last victim of woman&#8217;s tongue moved rapidly
towards the front lawn seeking safety amidst aged
women. On the way he passed a fellow sufferer.</p>

<p>Serena&#8217;s cutting remarks had, for Ike, turned an
afternoon of pleasure and recreation into a time of humiliation.
Here was music, food, agreeable company,
all turned into dust by public reprimands. Yet the
inextinguishable fire of hope burned in his breast. In
the fullness of time, Serena might forget, allow him
to enter the kitchen as one in good standing and, in the
alluring company of the colored maids, to partake of
refreshments. Until then he must wait. Doing this,
he watched the assemblage with melancholy eyes. He
considered the band futile. It played no jazz. In an
unhappy hour, tobacco brings solace to man. Ike produced
a cigarette. Lighting it, he puffed nervously,
suspecting the use of the weed in this haunt of aged
women to be taboo. Happy laughter arose in the
kitchen easily identified as the hearty tones of Serena,
amused, a favorable augury to the courtier cooling his
heels in the ante room. Casting down his cigarette,
Ike turned to reconnoiter. The butt dropped beneath
the porch into some ancient leaves, damp but inflammable.</p>

<p>The leaves ignited and smouldered. Fanned by a
gentle breeze the fire grew into a burning which produced
much smoke and little flame.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>Upon the porch sat Mrs. Comfort Bean. Life to
her was an open book. She had survived three husbands.
The first, a drunkard, had drowned, not in
rum, but in the river into which he had the misfortune
to fall while returning home from a convivial evening
enjoyed with other gay lads at the village tavern. The
second, a gambler, was shot in an altercation over the
ill-timed presence of five aces in a card game. The
third, a fragile thing, had faded like a flower. Mrs.
Bean had neither regrets for, nor fear of, man. She
knew him too well. She had come to anchor in the
Lucinda Home like a storm ridden ship seeking safe
harbor after a stormy passage. Here lay a peace the
like of which she had never known.</p>

<p>But one cloud rested upon her horizon. Mrs. Bean
was afraid of fire. She considered that because the
inmates could not dwell upon the ground floor of the
Home, the place was a fire trap and the most horrible
holocaust, not only possible but probable. To inure
herself to the inevitable, she read the harrowing details
of every fire involving fatalities.</p>

<p>Having enjoyed refreshments, Mrs. Bean had retired
to the porch that she might listen to the music in the
peace of her own thoughts. She sniffed. It was but
a tentative sniff. Not a full, deep whiff. Such sniffs
she gave many times each day. &#8220;Somethin&#8217;s burnin&#8217;,&#8221;
said Mrs. Comfort Bean. Hearers being absent, there
was no sympathetic response. &#8220;I smell fire,&#8221; she announced
in louder tones. A phenomenon puzzled Mrs.
Bean&#8217;s highly developed olfactory nerves. Her nostrils
were assailed by the odor of ignited hay instead of
the fateful smell of burning wood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>The fire smouldered and spread. A gust of wind
came. Mrs. Comfort Bean, sniffing expectantly, was
enveloped in a thin cloud of smoke. It caught her
when, dissatisfied by preliminary investigations, she
had taken a full, deep whiff. Mrs. Bean was almost
asphyxiated. Gasping and choking she strangled in
the efficient smudge of Ike&#8217;s preparing. A change in
the wind relieved her. &#8220;Fire!&#8221; she screamed.</p>

<p>As this fateful cry, anguish-toned, rang over the
festive throng, many an aged heart stood still. Shrieks
arose as well as answering alarms. For the moment
terror held them, and then certain women rushed for
the building that they might ascend to their apartments
and rescue choice possessions. Other more hardened
spirits removed their chairs to positions of advantage
that in greater comfort, they might &#8220;Watch the blamed
old thing burn down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coolness of military men was well exemplified
by Colonel Ryan. He arose from his chair at the first
alarm and shouted, &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; in a voice which had
arisen above the roar of cannon. Perceiving the stampede
towards the building, he thundered, &#8220;Two of
you waiters keep those women out of there.&#8221; In utter
disregard of the high cost of shoes, he roared, &#8220;Stamp
that fire out!&#8221; In searching tones, he demanded,
&#8220;Who set it?&#8221; No guilty man confessed, but Ike
became ill at ease and sought retirement in the crowd.</p>

<p>The Colonel turned to the leader of the band which
rested between numbers. &#8220;Play!&#8221; he commanded.
These ancient musicians had little regard for modern
music. They loved the tuneful airs of the past and
were about to render some selections from &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
Serenade.&#8221; At the word of the leader, the chorus from
&#8220;Don Jose of Seville,&#8221; the words of which run, &#8220;Let
her go, piff, paff,&#8221; pealed forth.</p>

<p>To avert impending peril, Mrs. Comfort Bean had
remained upon the porch emitting loud screams at intervals
as if they were minute guns. She disappeared
into the hall. She was back in a moment. Kelly was
gazing beneath the porch at the smouldering leaves.
She called to him, &#8220;You big red-headed feller,&#8221; and
when he looked up, she screamed, &#8220;Fire extinguisher.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded understandingly and in a moment had
procured the apparatus from the hall and carried it to
the end of the porch where a group of waiters, assisted
by their late enemy, Mr. Jones, were endeavoring to
stamp the fire out.</p>

<p>For an instant Kelly perused the directions. Then
he inverted the extinguisher. There was a hissing as
of a monstrous snake. From the nozzle gushed a
fizzing, sizzling jet like a soda fountain in action.
Kelly whirled about to bring the stream to bear upon
the conflagration. As he turned, the frothing liquid
circled with him and cut the check suit of Mr. Jones,
the white coats of the waiters, and the Norfolk jacket
of Ike, at the waist line. Now arose the protests and
violent language of angry men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You big chump, ain&#8217;t you got no sense?&#8221; gasped
Mr. Jones, ungrammatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the way so that I can put this fire out.
You are kicking it all over the place,&#8221; the bookkeeper
responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have as much right here as you&#8211;you big lump
of grease,&#8221; proclaimed Mr. Jones as he inspected with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
indignation the dark colored belt with which he had
been invested.</p>

<p>Kelly cast a menacing look at the stenographer.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t shut up, I am going to stick this nozzle
down your throat,&#8221; he threatened.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones watched the fizzling stream as if estimating
its physiological effect under the conditions named,
and remained silent.</p>

<p>Loud laughter sounded in the kitchen. Ike, cooled
by his bath, had presented himself for comforting.</p>

<p>Serena thus welcomed him. &#8220;Dey souse you in
saltpeter an&#8217; you done smoke youse&#8217;f so you mus&#8217; be
cu&#8217;ed lak er ham. Sit by de stove. Ah gwine give
you er cup o&#8217; coffee,&#8221; she chuckled, &#8220;ef yo&#8217;all smells
ham er feels youse&#8217;f er beginnin&#8217; to fry, git out o&#8217; yere
afo you greases de flo.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ike rested in comfort, sandwiches and coffee at
his side, and smiled pleasantly upon the maids. Truly,
after affliction, he had entered into the blessings of the
promised land.</p>

<p>The fire was out. Kelly moved to return the extinguisher
to its place. With a thud, a white bundle
dropped from the third floor upon his head. It appeared
soft but upon its touch Kelly sank to the ground,
blinking vacantly.</p>

<p>Forgetful of their recent altercation, Mr. Jones
rushed to his fellow worker&#8217;s assistance. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Kelly rubbed his head. &#8220;Somebody hit me with a
rock,&#8221; he answered, observing Mr. Jones meanwhile
with suspicion.</p>

<p>The stenographer kicked the bundle open. Then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
howling with pain, he grabbed his toe. In the center
of the bundle lay a mantel clock. &#8220;Might have killed
you&#8211;easy,&#8221; he spluttered at Kelly, and raised indignant
eyes to where an old woman, her wrinkled face
filled with anxiety, leaned over the railing. &#8220;Did you
throw that clock?&#8221; demanded Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>She held her hand to her ear and smiled sweetly.
&#8220;What?&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clock,&#8221; bawled Mr. Jones. &#8220;Did you drop that
clock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clock,&#8221; yelled the private secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s mine. Thank you for telling me that it is
not hurt,&#8221; she responded in great contentment to the
vexed Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>The reunited official staff of Obadiah moved on, one
member limping, the other caressing his head.</p>

<p>Gentle peace returned for the moment to the emotion-swept
aged ones. But now, through the gates of the
Home rushes the fire department of South Ridgefield.
With awe inspiring roar and mighty clangor of bells
the engines advance, reflecting gorgeously in the afternoon
sun. Taxpayers must have thrilled with pride
as they remarked the speed of approach and energy
with which these public servants entered upon their
duties. Even as they halt, powerful pumps sound,
ready to deluge the edifice with water while enthusiastic
men with axes rush into the halls and upon the
roof, prepared to hew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the fire?&#8221; demanded the chief in a voice
of authority.</p>

<p>Silently, Mrs. Bean led him to the blackened leaves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>&#8220;Who turned in that alarm?&#8221; he asked with great
sternness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; calmly replied the widow of three.</p>

<p>For a moment he looked down into the wrinkled face
filled with the pride and satisfaction of duty well done.
He raised his helmet and scratched his head. &#8220;The
whole department out for a bonfire,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>

<p>Virginia came and smiled timidly at this burly man.
&#8220;I am sorry that you have been given all of this trouble,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I have arranged to serve refreshments
to your men, if you don&#8217;t object.&#8221;</p>

<p>When his little hostess left him, the grim old fire
fighter stood at the head of the steps and gazed at the
waiters ministering with energy to the voracious appetites
of his men. &#8220;Huh,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;looks like
that blame bonfire cooked up a pretty good feed for my
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>The concert ended and the musicians awaited, in a
group, the truck which was to take them back to the
Soldiers&#8217; Home. Colonel Ryan went to speak to the
leader. As he turned to Virginia, who had been at his
side, he discovered her thanking the members of the
organization individually for their part in the concert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your music was beautiful,&#8221; she told a cornet
player. &#8220;Every one enjoyed it so much.&#8221; She made
apology to the entire number. &#8220;It is too bad that the
fire alarm disturbed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That weren&#8217;t no disturbance, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the cornetist
reassured her. He was bowed with age and had a
shrill cracked voice. Tucking his instrument under his
arm, he filled a disreputable pipe and went on. &#8220;No,
Ma&#8217;am, that weren&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call no disturbance. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
the war our old Colonel used to make us go out on the
skirmish line and play. Our leader allowed that the
rattle of bullets on the drum heads ruined the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How brave of you,&#8221; Virginia marveled at this
thumping tale of war.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had to be brave in my regiment, Ma&#8217;am. Old
Colonel Dean was a bob-cat and he expected his men to
be catamounts,&#8221; he cackled.</p>

<p>A clarionetist chewed a stubby mustache and listened
to the remarks of the cornet player with a hostile air.
&#8220;They ain&#8217;t over their squallin&#8217; yit,&#8221; he proclaimed,
and the musicians roared with laughter.</p>

<p>Shaking his old pipe wrathfully at his fellows, the
man with the cornet challenged them. &#8220;Colonel Dean
was a bob-cat,&#8221; he maintained. &#8220;A ragin&#8217;, clawin&#8217;,
scratchin&#8217;, bob-cat of a fighter and the whole regiment
was just like the old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the name Dean was mentioned, an old lady arose
from a group with whom she had been chatting and
drew near the musicians. She was tall and dignified
and a cap of lace was pinned upon her snowy head.
She peered at the cornetist through her spectacles.
&#8220;Were you speaking of Colonel Dean of the Infantry?&#8221;
she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the cornet player growled. &#8220;I was
a talkin&#8217; about old Colonel Dean of my regiment, a
ragin&#8217;, clawin&#8217;, scratchin&#8217;, fightin&#8217; man.&#8221; His bellicose
tones indicated the danger of contradiction and displayed
a suspicion that his questioner lifted her voice
in behalf of his opponents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Dean,&#8221; she said gently, &#8220;was my husband.
Were you with him at Shiloh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>A great change swept over the cornetist. He bowed
deeply, his hat sweeping the ground. His voice was
reverential, even tender, as he replied, &#8220;I was behind
him there, Ma&#8217;am&#8211;his bugler. I helped to carry him
from the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>The group was very serious now. When the old
veteran spoke again he could not conceal the emotion
which shook him. &#8220;Colonel Dean lived a brave man,
Ma&#8217;am, and he died&#8211;&#8221; he hesitated, seeking words&#8211;&#8220;just
like a soldier orter die.&#8221; He straightened
proudly, his old eyes flashing. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; he called,
&#8220;my Colonel&#8217;s lady. Attention!&#8221; As one man they
stiffened. Each hand sought the rim of a hat and together
swept forward in the old time salute.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean acknowledged the honor with a bow of
great dignity, but the wrinkled hand at her side was
shaking. For an instant the frail body held its poise
and then broke beneath the storm of feeling which
beset it. She seemed to shrink and would have fallen
had not Virginia caught the withered form in her arms
and helped the old lady to a seat. After a time the
tears were fewer and the sobs lessened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean turned to the girl. &#8220;Forgive me, child,&#8221;
she begged. &#8220;Forgive the weakness of an old
woman.&#8221; A withered hand stroked a soft white one.
&#8220;You have given me great happiness today, dearie.&#8221;
Her eyes returned to the waiting members of the band.
&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said very gently, &#8220;my soldier boys wish
to speak to me.&#8221; She arose and one by one and silently
the musicians came forward and took her hand.</p>

<p>A little later Mrs. Henderson and Hezekiah found
Virginia at the foot of the steps where she had just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
left Mrs. Dean. The girl was gazing off into the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia Dale, you have been crying,&#8221; Hennie said,
as she noted a telltale moisture of the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Hennie, I am wonderfully happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much so that you had to cry, dearie?&#8221; The
older woman smiled tenderly. Raising her hands she
caught Virginia&#8217;s cheeks between them and looked
down into the big blue eyes. &#8220;It was a success, dear&#8211;a
great success,&#8221; she giggled mischievously for one
of her years. &#8220;You told us, remember, that the place
needed stirring up. Bless your heart, you shook it
with an earthquake.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>MORE TROUBLE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;It is a fine form of advertisement and comes
cheap,&#8221; thought Obadiah as he read, with pleasure,
certain laudatory references to himself and his daughter,
in an article regarding the concert at the Lucinda
Home, prominently displayed in the morning paper.</p>

<p>He told her about it. &#8220;There is a very nice account
of your concert at the Lucinda Home. They give you
great credit.&#8221; He glanced at her proudly. &#8220;You
made a Dale success of it, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>His words as well as her own satisfaction at the
outcome of the concert made Virginia very happy.
All that morning she sang as she went about her various
affairs in the big house until Serena smiled to herself
and muttered, &#8220;Dat chil&#8217; is a mekin mo&#8217;e noise
an&#8217; er jay bird er yellin&#8217; caze de cher&#8217;ies is ripe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The joyous mood was yet upon the girl when she
went to the hospital that afternoon and found Joe
Curtis sitting up in bed for the first time. &#8220;You are
looking fine,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me blush. I am a modest youth,&#8221; he
protested.</p>

<p>Her cheeks flushed prettily. &#8220;I am not complimenting
your looks but your health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all due to the shave, anyway,&#8221; he grinned.
&#8220;The fatal symptoms are not so apparent.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>She observed his face with interest. &#8220;It does look
smoother,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;Who shaved you? Did
Miss Knight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; he whispered in mock terror. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let her hear you. She didn&#8217;t shave me, but she might
want to. That would be the last straw. My proud
spirit would never survive the outrage of that woman
wielding a razor over my tender skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ask her to shave you. Perhaps she may let
me help,&#8221; giggled Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always looked forward to your visits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be glad to see me even if I came to
shave you?&#8221; she demanded with severity.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me,&#8221; she commanded in a stern voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suffer great pain,&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are pretending. Answer my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>With closed eyes he pondered aloud. &#8220;If she
shaved me, her hands would touch my face. They
would caress my cheeks, softly&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia blushed. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t touch your face
for&#8211;for&#8211;anything,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you shave me then? Who ever heard
of a barber who did not touch the face of the people
he shaved?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do the shaving. I&#8217;ll bring the hot water.
It will be scalding hot, too,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coward,&#8221; he taunted her, &#8220;to scald a man with
three ribs and a leg broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a very friendly look for one supposed
to harbor such brutal intentions; but as he referred to
his injuries the fun died out of her face. &#8220;It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
unfair for you to suffer while I bear no part of the punishment
for my own thoughtlessness.&#8221; Her lips trembled.</p>

<p>Joe reached over and patted her hand. &#8220;It was my
own fault, I tell you,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;I am all hunky
dory now, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that my father would be glad to help you.
Won&#8217;t you let him, please?&#8221; she begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want no help.&#8221; His reply was brusque. &#8220;I am
able to take care of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia viewed him with thoughtful eyes. &#8220;I am
afraid, Joe,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;that you only look at this
matter from your own point of view. There is my
side, too. I want my conscience cleared of that old
accident. Every time I think of it, I am miserable.
Is it nice that I should be unhappy every time I think
of the first time I met you?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mood softened and his eyes showed it by their
tenderness. &#8220;I want every minute of your life to be
happy,&#8221; he said with warmth.</p>

<p>She reddened under his words but was quick to follow
up her advantage. &#8220;Help me to be, then,&#8221; she
pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There should be a way to satisfy us both,&#8221; he admitted.
He dropped his head back upon his pillow and
studied the ceiling for a time. He made a suggestion
but she shook her head violently.</p>

<p>She urged something and watched him expectantly.</p>

<p>All at once he began to chuckle. &#8220;I have it,&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>She leaned towards him and for a long time they
were engaged in a conversation which gave them both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
great pleasure and aroused their enthusiasm to the highest
degree.</p>

<p>Miss Knight came along the aisle and stopped at
Joe&#8217;s bedside. &#8220;You people are having such a good
time that I have to come and get into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They welcomed her as an intimate friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have Joe out in a roller chair before long,&#8221;
the nurse boasted. &#8220;That will be pleasanter because
he can receive his visitors on the lawn these fine days,&#8221;
she giggled. &#8220;After that it won&#8217;t be long until the
hour of sad farewells, will it, Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, there will be no tears in my
farewell I can tell you. I shall be so delighted to
get from under your tyrannical sway that I am afraid
my joy will give me a relapse and keep me in your
clutches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knight shook her head at the depravity of men.
&#8220;How&#8217;s that for ungratefulness? They bring him
to me helpless with pain and I bring him back to health.
Now he calls me a tyrant. Is that the way to reward
a faithful and devoted nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen a minute, Knightie,&#8221; begged Joe.</p>

<p>Virginia laughed barefacedly.</p>

<p>Miss Knight squelched the motorcyclist with a look,
and addressed her remarks to Virginia. &#8220;Did you
hear that, now? <i>Knightie</i>&#8211;what kind of a way is
that to address a lady? The minute you utter a kind
word near him, he gets gay. He&#8217;s the freshest thing
I ever had in this ward.&#8221; She shook her head with
weariness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my part. I have tried to train
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe attempted to smooth the ruffled feelings of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
nurse. &#8220;Sister,&#8221; he expostulated, &#8220;you don&#8217;t get
me&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; snapped Miss Knight, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t cut out
that &#8216;sister&#8217; habit I&#8217;ll get you all right before I am
done with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; groaned Joe. &#8220;What kind of a dump is
this anyway? They cure my leg but ruin my disposition.
No one could ever be the same after two months
in this ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I improve them in mind and body,&#8221; Miss Knight
boasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t improve a thing,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;This
place is a mad house. I am kept awake by the voices
of patients asking for poison to put them out of their
misery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those voices are calling for cooling drinks these
warm nights, which,&#8221; the nurse declared ruefully, &#8220;I
have to prepare in the hot afternoons.&#8221; Determination
seized her. &#8220;Joe Curtis,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you have
had enough lemonade this week to bathe in and I have
carried it to you. Unless you apologize immediately
you will get no more. There now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before such a threat, Joe meekly surrendered and
thus addressed the stern-faced nurse. &#8220;Miss Knight,
after listening to your bawling out, I know that I
should have called you &#8216;Rapper&#8217; instead of &#8216;Knightie,&#8217;
and I wouldn&#8217;t have you as a sister at any price.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse tossed her head in disdain. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care to be related to a motorcyclist,&#8221; she announced.</p>

<p>Joe grinned at Virginia. &#8220;What did I tell you?
No one cares for a motorcyclist. They have no
friends, even in a hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;Why should any one care about them? Their
troubles are due to their own foolishness. They are
a noisy pest in the streets and they get themselves hurt
and take up bed space in hospitals which might be devoted
to better uses.&#8221; Miss Knight&#8217;s seriousness gave
way and her eyes danced. &#8220;And they make their
nurses like them in spite of it all,&#8221; she laughed as she
hurried away to another patient.</p>

<p>Virginia watched Joe thoughtfully. &#8220;You take a
strange way to show Miss Knight that you like her,&#8221;
she told him. &#8220;You are always in an argument with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She starts the scrap, not I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you make her do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he declared with earnestness, &#8220;she jumps on
me to stir things up and give her something to talk
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you at all, Joe. You treat Miss
Knight so differently from the way you treat me. Yet,
you like her,&#8221; Virginia urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such great sport teasing her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tease me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe considered the question. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he
answered frankly. &#8220;I suppose it is because you are
different.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curiosity seized her. &#8220;How am I different?&#8221;</p>

<p>Great embarrassment held his tongue.</p>

<p>She was insistent. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you answer my question?&#8221;
she begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hard one. Perhaps I can&#8217;t answer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you can. Try.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made the attempt. &#8220;Perhaps it is because I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
have known girls like Miss Knight all of my life. I
played with them when I was a kid, went to school
with them, and, since I have been older, called on them
and took them to dances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever take them out on your motorcycle?&#8221;
demanded Virginia almost sharply.</p>

<p>The question surprised him. &#8220;No, I never had another
seat on my wheel. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing.&#8221; She was very indifferent now.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I approve of girls on motorcycles.
Go on,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;You were telling about taking
girls to dances. Where else did you take them?&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought a moment. &#8220;Sometimes I took them to
Vivian&#8217;s and had ice cream or took them to a motion
picture show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what fun.&#8221; Virginia was thinking aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She very calmly disregarded his question. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t told me how I am different,&#8221; she relentlessly
persisted. &#8220;Please do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the way we met, I suppose&#8211;the way I saw
you first,&#8221; he confessed, fighting back his embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about it, Joe,&#8221; she pleaded softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was regaining consciousness after the accident.
My whole body was a great pain. I was trying to understand
what had happened.&#8221; He hesitated and then
went on. &#8220;I opened my eyes. For an instant everything
was blurred and indistinct. Things were whirling
about in mists and billowy clouds. They rolled
apart and through them, constantly growing clearer,
came your face.&#8221; He was almost whispering now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
&#8220;You looked too beautiful for this world and I believed
that I was dead.&#8221; A little smile like a wavelet
before a summer&#8217;s zephyr swept over his face. &#8220;You
are a girl from the clouds to me,&#8221; he said gently.</p>

<p>A very flushed Virginia leaned towards him. A
great tenderness for this big fellow held her, and for
a moment she could not trust herself to speak. She
reached for his hand and held it in her own. &#8220;I must
go,&#8221; she murmured, as if driven away by her own
timidity, and then, giving him a smile of ineffable
sweetness, she left him.</p>

<p>Joe Curtis was so tumultuously happy for the rest
of that afternoon that it was necessary for Miss Knight
to reprove him on no less than three occasions.</p>

<p>Virginia called again upon Mr. Wilkins after leaving
the hospital. Her business with the lawyer was speedily
dispatched, and upon her departure for home, Hezekiah
presented himself before Obadiah for conference.</p>

<p>The manufacturer glanced at his counsel and indicated
a seat. &#8220;I was on the point of sending for
you,&#8221; he told Hezekiah, and in a characteristic way
went right to the matter upon his mind. &#8220;The river
water is bothering somebody again. They have started
that old row about the chemicals and dyes in the waste
from the dye-house at the mill poisoning the water.
The State Board of Health is trying to tell me that it
makes the water unfit for consumption in the towns
below and is responsible for certain forms of sickness
which have appeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad.&#8221; Hezekiah looked at the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s bad?&#8221; demanded Obadiah with asperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sickness,&#8221; the lawyer explained thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>&#8220;Oh, I thought you meant the waste from the dye-house,&#8221;
snarled Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t that bad, too? I certainly am glad
that South Ridgefield doesn&#8217;t take the water for its
supply below your mill. I shouldn&#8217;t care to drink it,
would you?&#8221; Hezekiah could be frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want to drink is not the question,&#8221; snapped
Obadiah, raising his voice a tone. The attitude of his
attorney had aroused his displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Hezekiah went on, &#8220;it&#8217;s what you can make
the other fellow drink which interests you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah considered the lawyer&#8217;s remarks unfortunate
even if true. &#8220;I am not trying to make anybody
drink. These people have been drinking the same
water for years and now some troublemaker stirs up a
hornets&#8217; nest,&#8221; he stormed. &#8220;They want to force me
to build three thousand feet of sewer to connect up
with the city system and its new fangled sewage disposal
plant. I suppose this town would want
rent for that, too. Did you ever hear of such foolishness?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer cast a keen glance at his employer.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;that you have doubled
the capacity of your mill in the last few years and
are running twice as much waste into the river as formerly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; roared Obadiah, in a high key. &#8220;It
will cost several thousand dollars to do what they want.
Let those towns take care of themselves. They must
mistake me for a philanthropist trying to give my
money away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah removed his glasses and closed his eyes as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
if desirous that no point, in the interesting thought of
Obadiah giving anything away, might perchance escape
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; bleated Obadiah, striking the desk
a resounding thump which made Hezekiah open his
eyes with a start. &#8220;I have been running waste into
that river for years and I intend to keep on doing it.&#8221;
He glared at the lawyer. &#8220;You look up the decisions
and be prepared to make those people drink ink if I
want to put it into the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah arose and moved over to the window.
Possibly the ascertainment of a legal method to force
citizens to accept writing fluid as a beverage perplexed
him. Yet, it couldn&#8217;t have been that, because his eyes
danced with the glee of a mischievous school boy, and
he seemed to have difficulty in suppressing inward
mirth, as one wishing to perpetrate a huge joke with
appropriate gravity.</p>

<p>In a moment he came back and faced Obadiah.
&#8220;You will be glad to know that a settlement has been
reached with young Curtis,&#8221; he announced impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have kept Virginia out of court proceedings?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah nodded.</p>

<p>Obadiah appeared relieved. &#8220;That is fine. I
would look like a fool with my own daughter testifying
against me in court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah was trying to catch Obadiah&#8217;s eye. &#8220;It is
going to cost you some money,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I
warned you that young people have no idea of the value
of money. Remember, you authorized me to make the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
best settlement that I could,&#8221; he sternly reminded the
mill owner.</p>

<p>Obadiah shrugged his shoulders irritably. &#8220;Yes, I
am bound by any nonsensical agreement you have
made.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attorney&#8217;s voice was cold, and there was a glint
of steel in his eyes as he answered, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t care
to accept the compromise for which I accept sole responsibility,
it is your privilege to reject it and take&#8211;the
consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah leaped to his feet and rushing to his lawyer
patted him upon the shoulder. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so touchy,
Hezekiah,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Have I ever failed to support
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Hezekiah admitted, &#8220;and you never will&#8211;but
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah was desirous of placating his counsel.
&#8220;You misunderstand me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I probably understand you better than any one else
on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remark made the manufacturer uncomfortable.
&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I agree to any arrangement
which you have made, because of my friendship,
if for no other reason.&#8221; He shook the lawyer&#8217;s hand.
&#8220;Explain the agreement. I consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah&#8217;s manner was too calm. It was like the
lull before a storm. &#8220;You pay no money to the injured
man,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s face registered his surprise. &#8220;What the
devil?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Hezekiah gave no heed to this remark but went on
with the solemnity of a judge sentencing a prisoner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
&#8220;You have agreed to furnish and to endow for a period
of five years, a private room at the South Ridgefield
Hospital to be used exclusively for the care and
treatment of injured motorcyclists.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>VIRGINIA HELPS AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>When Obadiah received the formal notice from the
hospital authorities of the acceptance of his gift, being
unversed in the ways of philanthropists, he sent for
Hezekiah and handed him the letter. &#8220;I want nothing
to do with this matter,&#8221; he snapped.</p>

<p>The lawyer bowed with great complacency.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be interested to know, as you didn&#8217;t take
the trouble to find out,&#8221; the mill owner sneered, &#8220;that
this fellow, Joseph Tolliver Curtis, is employed by the
State Board of Health. He spent his time prior to
the accident riding up and down the river taking samples
of the water to make a case against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem,&#8221; coughed the lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that fellow were getting a cent out of the agreement,&#8221;
Obadiah threatened, &#8220;I would break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the lawyer calmly. &#8220;I
drew it and it&#8217;s enforceable. If necessary I would go
into court myself to make you keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah glowered, but his eyes fell before those of
his attorney. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he growled finally, &#8220;we won&#8217;t
quarrel over it. You handle the matter.&#8221; A look of
distress came into his face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll sign the checks but
I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, even though her father refused to discuss the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
subject Virginia took up the matter of furnishing the
room with great enthusiasm. She sought advice from
many persons but particularly from Joe Curtis, who
was deemed, through sad experience, capable of expressing
the desires of injured motorcyclists, and Miss
Knight, who by long service had learned those things
which were not good for them.</p>

<p>After prolonged discussion, Virginia and Joe decided
that the room should be papered in an old fashioned
design with a background of egg-shell blue.
The windows were to be curtained with a fine net having
a filet edge, and the furniture was to be of massive
mahogany. Pictures portraying sporting scenes believed
suitable by Joe and of gentle landscapes considered
appropriate by the girl were to adorn the walls
in equal number. A harmonizing smoking set was
added, and the floor was to be strewn with Oriental
rugs. Thus furnished, it was confidently argued, the
room would be restful and agreeable to the most discriminating
of motorcyclists.</p>

<p>When this plan was presented with pride to Miss
Knight, she addressed the pair in a sarcastic manner,
&#8220;Did you by chance have in mind the furnishing of a
bridal suite? Haven&#8217;t you forgotten a breakfast room
and a pipe organ?&#8221;</p>

<p>Reduced to a fitting condition of humbleness they
sat at her feet, so to speak, as she discoursed. &#8220;The
room set aside is bright and cheery. Its walls, windows
and floor need no treatment. Put in a double
enameled bedstead&#8211;a brass one if you like. Have
an enameled dresser and a plain rocker and chairs of
similar type. You may have a plain wardrobe and an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
enameled medicine table, too. That&#8217;s all.&#8221; She
smiled at them. &#8220;I have conceded a lot, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have beautiful taste, Miss Knight. Don&#8217;t
you think so, Joe?&#8221; remarked Virginia with great
solemnity.</p>

<p>The motorcyclist nodded a vigorous agreement.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged the nurse became didactic. &#8220;The
furnishing of a room for the sick,&#8221; she lectured, &#8220;is
not a matter of taste. It is a question of cleanliness.
Give me a clean place with plenty of fresh air and
sunshine&#8211;nothing else counts.&#8221; Before such simplicity
the pretentious plans faded, and in the end
the wisdom of the nurse prevailed.</p>

<p>When Virginia left the ward that day it had grown
extremely warm. &#8220;Hotter than fiddlers in Tophet,&#8221;
Miss Knight called it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are those poor babies?&#8221; Virginia asked, as
from a distant part of the building came the petulant
sound of infants protesting in the only way they could
against the high temperature.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in the Free Dispensary,&#8211;the cases which
are brought in from the outside. They would wring
your heart,&#8221; the nurse answered.</p>

<p>Distress showed in Virginia&#8217;s face. &#8220;I am going
there and see if I can help,&#8221; she cried, and with a parting
smile at Miss Knight she hurried to the Dispensary.</p>

<p>Doctor Jackson nodded to her as she entered.
&#8220;Every degree that the temperature rises means more
sick babies,&#8221; he worried.</p>

<p>The peevish, fretful cries of the infants and the troubled
looks of the worn mothers filled the girl with pity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
&#8220;How dreadful, Doctor. The poor darlings. I wish
I could help them,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The medical man glanced at her with new interest.
&#8220;Miss Dale, didn&#8217;t you give that concert at the Lucinda
Home?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>When she answered him in the affirmative he came
over to her. His duck suit was rumpled and his collar
wilted. His hair was mussed where he had mopped
it back. In his hand was a clinical thermometer and
an odor of drugs surrounded him. &#8220;Miss Dale,&#8221; he
urged, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you get up a picnic and take these
mothers and babies into the country for a few hours?
You entertained the old ladies but you would save lives
if you could arrange to get some of these babies into a
cool place for awhile.&#8221; He became apologetic. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t mean to be insistent but I am interested in my
work and if I can keep any of them from dying in this
heat spell, I want to do it. You understand me, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do, Doctor Jackson. I will be only too
glad to get up a picnic.&#8221; A note of anxiety crept into
her voice. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t much time to prepare. If it
is to do good, we must have it at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, by all means,&#8221; urged the physician.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His enthusiasm filled her with energy. &#8220;It will be
dandy,&#8221; she cried, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.
&#8220;It will be difficult to arrange for, but we can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young medical man gave this pretty girl, flushed
with interest and confidence, a look of frank admiration.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket,&#8221; he shouted, tossing professional
dignity to the winds for the moment. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
can make things hum. Hop to it, kiddo.&#8221; Then more
seriously, &#8220;Let me know late this afternoon the arrangements
you have made. Call me by phone. I&#8217;ll
get word to the mothers if I have to carry it myself
this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s head was awhirl with vague plans when
she left the hospital.</p>

<p>On the way she espied Mrs. Henderson hurrying
down the street in utter disregard of the fiery
heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in, Hennie,&#8221; called Virginia, when Ike stopped
the car. &#8220;I must talk to you and I want to make you
as comfortable as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me, child,&#8221; protested the widow. &#8220;I
am a hardened sinner whom it behooves to become accustomed
to heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few words the girl explained the plan for the
picnic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a splendid thing to do,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
agreed. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll be glad to help. Good gracious,
sick babies all around us and at our church we
are dawdling over a new bell rope and a lock for the
front door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is such a relief to know that you are going to
help,&#8221; exclaimed Virginia; &#8220;but away down in my
heart I knew that you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, dearie, I&#8217;m an old crank who is always
minding other people&#8217;s business&#8211;and getting
kicked for it,&#8221; she ended petulantly. &#8220;Hereafter,&#8221;
she affirmed emphatically, &#8220;I am going to attend to my
own affairs.&#8221; A great energy filled her and she turned
to Virginia, her own words forgotten. &#8220;What can I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
do? If you will let Serena help me, I will attend to
the refreshments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hennie, you are a dear&#8211;that much is settled.&#8221;
Virginia sighed with relief. &#8220;Now where can we have
the picnic? Parks which have bands and dancing
won&#8217;t do at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right. These mothers and babies need
rest and quiet. A grove by the river would be ideal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, surely, that is where we must go.&#8221; The girl
waxed enthusiastic. &#8220;The babies can roll upon the
grass and play together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks,&#8221; objected Mrs. Henderson. &#8220;If you
put babies on the ground they will eat bugs, and if you
allow them to roll they will go into the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they must be entertained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proper entertainment for babies,&#8221; observed the
childless widow sagely, &#8220;is eating and sleeping with
crying to while away leisure moments.&#8221; She leaned
towards Ike. &#8220;Young man, do you know of a shady
place along the river where we can have a picnic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m,&#8221; responded the ever courteous chauffeur.
&#8220;Elgin&#8217;s Grove is er nice place fo&#8217; er picnic or a
barbecue. Heaps o&#8217; shade an&#8217; de aiah is mighty cool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217; heard about nobody gwine dyah lately,
Ma&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made people stop going?&#8221; asked the widow,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey fou&#8217;t dyah. Er man got killed in er fight an&#8217;
de she&#8217;iff close de gamblin&#8217; house. Ain&#8217; nothin&#8217; to go
dyah fo&#8217; now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very strange that I never heard of the place.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>&#8220;Maybe dey done specify it to you by de common
folk&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some folks calls it Faro Beach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson gasped. The name recalled shocking
stories of a river resort where games of chance had
flourished in open disregard of the law until a murder
had awakened public conscience and it had been closed.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of going there,&#8221; she objected, and
suddenly she began to laugh. &#8220;We are creatures of
convention. What difference does it make what the
place was? Indeed, if they were gambling now it
wouldn&#8217;t hurt these mothers and their babies.&#8221; Her
manner became decisive. &#8220;Virginia, as soon as you
have your lunch, go and see the place. If it is what
we want, make arrangements for the use of it. We
don&#8217;t care about its history.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, when Virginia arrived at
Elgin&#8217;s Grove that afternoon she found that Ike&#8217;s description
was not exaggerated. Great oaks towered
towards the blue sky shading a green sod, clear of
underbrush, rolling towards the river. The buildings
were good, although locked, and there was a well with
a pump at which Ike, much oppressed by the heat, refreshed
himself, and recommended the water to Virginia
as of superior quality, in these words. &#8220;It
tast&#8217;tes lak de water f&#8217;om de seep back o&#8217; ma ole home
in Tennessee. Dats de fines&#8217; water in de worl&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The owner of the grove, a farmer, living a bachelor
existence, after listening in a cold and suspicious manner
to Virginia&#8217;s enthusiastic description of the purposes
of the picnic, suddenly thawed. Refusing pay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
for the grove, he announced his personal desire to be
present. Having been straightway invited by Virginia,
he agreed to unlock a building to afford shelter
in case of rain, mow among the trees to scare out the
snakes, and to clean out the well to insure a pure water
supply. &#8220;Coming on the <i>Nancy Jane</i>?&#8221; he asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The Nancy Jane?</i>&#8221; questioned the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the steamboat that used to run here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia became interested. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that
steamboats ran on this river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Nancy Jane</i> ain&#8217;t exactly running,&#8221; admitted
the farmer. &#8220;She is tied up at South Ridgefield unless
she&#8217;s sunk since last week. The <i>Nancy Jane</i> is the
best way to get to this grove and old Bill Quince is
the man to bring the old boat here. Bill Quince knows
this river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it be safe to bring the babies on it?&#8221; Virginia
asked, troubled.</p>

<p>The farmer chuckled softly. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t in nigh as
much danger of drownin&#8217; on the old Lame Moose as
of stickin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem such a terrible calamity,&#8221;
laughed Virginia. &#8220;I will see Mr. Quince and inquire
about his boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice trip, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the farmer encouraged
her. &#8220;Bill Quince made it twice a day for two years
a-carrying drunks, mostly, with nary an accident. He
is a fine man. A natural born sailor, Bill is. Takes
to the water like a duck. You won&#8217;t make no mistake
a trustin&#8217; Bill Quince, I promise you, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat Mr. Quince is er gran&#8217; man,&#8221; Ike told Virginia,
on their journey home. &#8220;He done save de life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
o&#8217; er po&#8217; colored boy wot was er fishin&#8217; off de bank by
his house. De pole dat de boy cut f&#8217;om de bresh ain&#8217;
long &#8217;nough to rech out to de deep water whar de big
fishes is. He done git hisse&#8217;f er plank an&#8217; puts one
end under er log an&#8217; rest&#8217;tes de middle on a rock at
de aidge o&#8217; de bank. Den he clum out on tother en&#8217;
ovah de water. Long come &#8217;nother boy an&#8217; rolls de
log. De fisherman draps in de river. He done sink
de secon&#8217; time an&#8217; give er scan&#8217;lous yell. Mr. Quince
rest&#8217;tes hisse&#8217;f by de house an&#8217; he hear &#8217;im. Mr.
Quince tek er quick look an&#8217; den he grab er pole wid
er i&#8217;on hook off de house an hooks de boy in de britches
an&#8217; hauls &#8217;im out, jes as he sink de las&#8217; time. Den he
stan&#8217;s dat kid on his haid an&#8217; let de water run outen
him an&#8217; puts ointment on his purson, whar de hook dig
&#8217;im. He ain&#8217; no time think &#8217;bout de floater money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What money?&#8221; inquired Virginia, much interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;De floater money. Mr. Quince bein&#8217; er river man,
he catches de daid wot floats down de river, an&#8217; de
county dey give &#8217;im ten dollars fo&#8217; each floater he git.
Dat boy jes de same as daid. If Mr. Quince catch
&#8217;m er minute later, er hol&#8217; &#8217;im undah er minute, dat
boy die an&#8217; Mr. Quince git ten dollars. Dat man is
er hero, Miss Virginy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl shuddered. &#8220;Stop talking about dead people,
Ike, you make me nervous,&#8221; she remonstrated, and,
as they crossed the bridge, a creepy Virginia thought
she caught shadowy glimpses in the green depths of
a gruesome opportunity for Mr. Quince to win anew
a reward from his grateful county.</p>

<p>The habitation of Mr. Quince presented much of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
interest. It was airily although damply situated at the
point of a promontory where Hog Creek emptied its
limited flow into the Lame Moose River. The site was
desirable for a man of Mr. Quince&#8217;s tastes and aspirations.
Upon the one hand, the river afforded a pleasant
marine foreground for the abattoirs and packing-houses,
veiled in odoriferous smoke, upon the opposite
shore. On the other hand, the quiet waters of Hog
Creek offered a safe anchorage for the good ship
<i>Nancy Jane</i> and a fleet of skiffs in various stages of
decay.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince was a man of ingenuity and resourcefulness,
and a natural forager. On the day that he
selected this site, for the sojournment of himself and
a stray youth who had elected to follow his fortunes,
Mr. Quince built a fire and cooked some fish. The
next sun saw a brush leanto constructed, shortly made
impervious to rain by a covering of old canvas. This
structure was followed in turn, as freshets deposited
their beneficent fruits, by a board shack, a hut and at
last a something which a charitable public called a
house.</p>

<p>While the evolution of Mr. Quince&#8217;s fireside furnished
much of professional interest to sociologists, it
was viewed by that soulless corporation which owned
the land, a railroad company, as an attempt to establish
adverse possession, by open, notorious, and hostile
occupancy. Divers ejectments, although temporarily
successful, failed of permanent effect and Mr. Quince
dwelt in more or less of a state of siege.</p>

<p>Virginia found the riverman seated before his house,
in a chair shaped out of a barrel, and prevented from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
being mislaid by its permanent attachment to a post
in the ground. His experienced eyes watched the surface
of the river for signs of treasure trove awash.
Upon the front of his residence, conveniently at hand,
hung the pole with the iron hook, while, at the foot of
a precipitous pathway, an old skiff bobbed, readily
available to meet emergencies of the deep.</p>

<p>The arrival of the automobile startled Mr. Quince.
To this aquatic man, a boat upon the river offered the
more agreeable pathway to his home. He arose nervously,
as one suspecting ejectment proceedings. The
wind blew his patched overalls and flannel shirt about
his tall, thin figure.</p>

<p>Ike, bowing respectfully, spoke words of greeting.
&#8220;Howdy, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; returned the mariner, calmed by the
thought that it was not the custom of courts to rely
upon such instrumentalities as negro chauffeurs and
young maidens.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to rent your boat for a picnic at Elgin&#8217;s
Grove tomorrow,&#8221; called Virginia.</p>

<p>The tender of charter appeared to surprise Mr.
Quince. He removed his ancient hat and scratched
his scalp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your boat?&#8221; Virginia looked about as
if expecting to discover the <i>Priscilla</i> or <i>Commonwealth</i>
at rest upon the bosom of Hog Creek.</p>

<p>The riverman pointed and the girl&#8217;s eyes followed
his finger.</p>

<p>On the creek floated a monument to the ingenuity of
Bill Quince. Contrary to accepted naval traditions,
the <i>Nancy Jane</i> was in two parts. A rusty traction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
engine rested upon a decked scow almost square in
form. It was geared by belt, chains and sprockets to
a water wheel as wide as the scow and attached to its
stern. This was the power plant, and, coupled to
the front of it, was a second scow of like width but
greater length. Decked over, railed, and covered by
a wooden canopy, it furnished the passenger accommodations
of the craft.</p>

<p>Such disappointment as Virginia felt was swept
aside by the profound admiration of Ike for this vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s er fine boat,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Ah done
had ma good times on dat ole boat. When you gits
out on de cool river on dat ship you feels like er
fightin&#8217; cock on er hot night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike&#8217;s reference to the cool river encouraged his mistress
to continue negotiations. &#8220;Can we rent it?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You kin rent it if you want to. They hain&#8217;t no
law again it,&#8221; the mariner agreed. &#8220;But I hain&#8217;t sure
that she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to move none.&#8221; His sporting blood
was aroused. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet two bits that old engine is
a-rusted tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia desired certainty. &#8220;How am I going to
find out if the boat will go?&#8221; she worried.</p>

<p>Approaching the car, Mr. Quince rested an elbow
upon the edge of the door and a huge foot upon the
running board. His thin jaw wagged incessantly and
his eyes viewed the distant reaches of the river as he
pensively ruminated upon the problem. At last a
solution came to him. &#8220;We mought hist &#8217;er over by
hand,&#8221; he told Ike.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; the girl inquired anxiously, puzzled at
what was to be &#8220;histed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See if we can turn the old engine over,&#8221; explained
Mr. Quince.</p>

<p>Ike having agreed to the suggestion, he and the riverman
clambered down the bank and across a plank
to the deck of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>. A period of silence ensued,
broken by violent language when Mr. Quince
put his confidence in and his weight against a rotten
lever. There followed the sound of strong men grunting
and breathing heavily. A sudden scramble took
place and with a great splash the wheel of the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> clove the amber surface of Hog Creek.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince and Ike returned, perspiring freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;She turned,&#8221; declared Mr. Quince with pride.
&#8220;She hain&#8217;t rusted up much in nigh unto two
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it settled? We can rent the boat?&#8221; demanded
Virginia, all business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t so sure,&#8221; replied the mariner doubtfully.
&#8220;This yere river bottom changes every day. I hain&#8217;t
took the <i>Nancy Jane</i> to Elgin&#8217;s Grove in two year. I
dunno as I knows where the old channel has gone. I
guess I plum forgot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we get some one who knows the river?&#8221;
Virginia failed to reckon with the pride of seafaring
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;There hain&#8217;t no man knows the Lame Moose like
I knows her,&#8221; protested Mr. Quince greatly offended.
&#8220;I allers was the pilot of the <i>Nancy Jane</i> and I still
aims so to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia smiled sweetly at the hurt riverman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
&#8220;Please take us up in your boat. It will be so much
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quince surrendered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the old boat
to the grove if I have to wait for the spring freshets
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be dangerous, will it?&#8221; cried Virginia,
disturbed by the vigor of the mariner&#8217;s remarks. &#8220;The
boat won&#8217;t sink, will it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t make no odds, nohow,&#8221; Mr. Quince
reassured her. &#8220;That bottom of the Lame Moose is
so near the top you wouldn&#8217;t know no difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was finally agreed that the <i>Nancy Jane</i> should
await the arrival of its passengers at a convenient place
below the highway bridge at the hour of ten on the
next morning. But, before they left, Mr. Quince,
after inspecting the cars upon nearby switch tracks,
announced, &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to have no coal a layin&#8217;
around handy, so I better have five bucks on account in
case I have to buy some.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN OUTING AND AN ACCIDENT</span></h2>

<p>The heat wave had not broken in the morning. At
eight o&#8217;clock South Ridgefield sweltered beneath a
rising temperature with no promise of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor babies!&#8221; thought Virginia. &#8220;It is hotter
than ever; but the picnic will help them.&#8221; She remembered
how warm it had been at the hospital on
the previous day and fell to thinking of Joe Curtis,
and her eyes grew soft and dreamy as she wished
that he was going on the river trip.</p>

<p>The high temperature had caused Obadiah to spend
a restless night and he was peevish and irritable when
Virginia told him of the plans for the day. &#8220;You
should not have mixed up in such matters without consulting
me,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;It is indiscreet and may
lead to your embarrassment. That hole up the river
used to have a most unsavory reputation.&#8221; He
paused as if seeking for other objections, and then
went on. &#8220;You might get a sun stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment she had her arms about his neck and
kissed him. &#8220;There it is, Daddy. Thinking of me
as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I help&#8211;,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>

<p>She gave a joyous laugh and interrupted him. &#8220;I
knew that you would want to help, too, Daddy. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
may&#8211;allow Mr. Jones and Mr. Kelly to come to the
picnic. It will be an outing which they will enjoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah drew away from her caresses. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
interfere with my office,&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;I was greatly
embarrassed when I returned on the afternoon of the
concert and found no one there. I spoke to them both
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia flushed with feeling. &#8220;Did they tell you
that I asked them to come?&#8221; she demanded, and when
his face admitted it, she continued, &#8220;Regardless of
the permission you gave me in this very room to ask
any one I wished to the concert, you criticised me,
Daddy, to your employees. If you objected to my actions,
why didn&#8217;t you come to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The unwonted stand of his daughter made Obadiah
ill at ease. He flushed angrily and then regained control
of himself. &#8220;There, there, don&#8217;t get excited. I
didn&#8217;t say much&#8211;a mere nothing.&#8221; He drew her towards
him but she held her head stiffly, looking straight
ahead. He kissed her cheek and whispered, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be cross, dear. Of course Kelly and Jones may go to
your picnic, if you want them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to him. The look of injury was gone.
&#8220;I was cross, Daddy. I did wrong, and I beg your
pardon.&#8221; She raised her lips for him to kiss and gave
a little laugh in which there were memories of sadness.</p>

<p>That morning there was unusual activity on the
South Ridgefield river front. The peace of Hog
Creek was disturbed by the clang of shovels, the ring
of slice bars, and the hissing of steam. Billowy clouds
of smoke curling from the funnel of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
mixed with the river mist and gave variety to the
smells emanating from the slaughter houses on the
further shore.</p>

<p>As the sun dissipated the fog, the <i>Nancy Jane</i> left
her anchorage, and, with much puffing and squeaking,
breasted the sluggish current of the Lame Moose River.
To the youth of the town, the reappearance of the
craft was a matter of supreme interest, and, grouped
along the bank, they gave voice to their pleasure in
cheers. So, it is painted, the rural New Yorkers
greeted the maiden voyage of the <i>Clermont</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Nancy Jane</i> hove to and made fast at her appointed
tryst with the babies. Thereafter, Mr. Quince,
bearing the pole with the iron hook as arms, acted as
a landing party, and dispersed groups of youth who
displayed a disposition to visit the ship without invitation.</p>

<p>Dr. Jackson came aboard at an early hour, and
caused a truck load of cots to be arranged in two long
rows down the center of the deck. Upon these he
prepared comfortable beds of blankets.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince viewed these activities in the light of
his personal experiences. &#8220;I have seen &#8217;em dance
and sing and fight on the <i>Nancy Jane</i> but I hain&#8217;t
never seen nobody sleep much, leastwise, if they was
sober.&#8221; Suspicion entered his mind regarding the
intentions of the physician. &#8220;You hain&#8217;t a thinkin&#8217;
of pullin&#8217; off no booze party in these prohibition times,
air yer?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want no law on
me. I&#8217;m a respectable man and I runs a respectable
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The distrust cast upon his efforts to relieve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
suffering disgusted the doctor. &#8220;You attend to your business
and I&#8217;ll attend to mine. You can kick when I
start something wrong,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, old hoss, I have warned yer. There&#8217;s
a cop on the bridge a watching yer, now.&#8221; Mr. Quince
pointed to where a policeman leaned lazily over the
bridge rail and inspected the <i>Nancy Jane</i> with the mild
curiosity aroused by its re-advent upon the river.</p>

<p>The absurd suggestion of the riverman irritated the
doctor to redoubled energy. Jumping on the bank,
he seized a carboy of lime water which he wrapped in
a blanket and brought aboard, endeavoring to protect
it from the sun&#8217;s rays by concealing it beneath a
cot.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince&#8217;s worst suspicions were confirmed. He
called to his follower. &#8220;Sim, come here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad approached. He was coolly attired in a
worn shirt, overalls and a broken straw hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sim, be my witness.&#8221; The manner of Mr. Quince
was dignified, as befitted one taking part in a legal
ceremonial. He turned towards the busy medical man,
a law-abiding citizen virtuously facing one of criminal
desires. &#8220;I hereby warns yer agin&#8217; putting any licker
on this yere boat,&#8221; he cried in a stern voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up,&#8221; shouted the aggravated Doctor.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard him and you heard me, Sim. Now
I got the goods on that feller if we git pinched,&#8221; and,
with an effort to engrave the matter upon the mind of
his follower, the riverman concluded in the accepted
tone of Hamlet&#8217;s ghost, &#8220;Remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ayah,&#8221; responded the indifferent Sim.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>The arrival of members of the picnic party prevented
further discussion of this matter.</p>

<p>Down the steps from the bridge they came, a sisterhood
of the tired, the worried, the anxious. The cruel
strokes of labor and poverty were relentlessly erasing
the softness of youth. The bearing of children and
unceasing toil had destroyed their figures, and already
the weariness of age was creeping into their movements.</p>

<p>Yet this was no gathering of the sorrowing. Upon
each breast rested, in gentle embrace, the fulfillment of
womanhood. Their pledge to the perpetuation of their
kind, their duty to the responsibilities and opportunities
of dawning centuries. The pride of motherhood
was upon worn faces as coverings were adjusted about
soft cheeks and tiny eyes twinkled and fat hands made
spasmodic efforts to grasp something where nothing
was. Coarse and strident voices dropped to a musical
tenderness as they harked to the mysterious language
of baby land.</p>

<p>Even as the first mothers arrived, came Virginia
followed by Serena and Ike, carrying food. Mr.
Vivian appeared, bringing monstrous ice cream freezers.
Mrs. Henderson headed a small procession consisting
of a man bringing oceans of milk and another
with perfect bergs of ice.</p>

<p>The mothers charged upon Dr. Jackson, the familiar
friend of their households, in noisy confusion. In
sharp and emphatic tones, he brought order out of this
feminine chaos in a manner pleasing even to that
marine disciplinarian, Mr. Quince, who had watched
the arrival of his passengers with great astonishment.
Two lines of kicking, struggling, emotion swept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
infants were stretched upon the cots, and lifted their
voices in a chorus which sounded above the hiss of
steam from the boiler.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince was an adaptable man, and, regardless
of his amazement at the character of his cargo, he
rose to the occasion. Boarding his ship, he inspected
the rows of infants. &#8220;Wisht I&#8217;d a knowed these yere
kids,&#8221; he worried. &#8220;I mought a picked up some old
trunk checks at the railroad station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for, Mr. Quince?&#8221; asked Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of these yere kids a lyin&#8217; around careless
like is agoin&#8217; to git mixed up and start the allfiredest
fight amongst these women folks. Nothin&#8217; makes a
woman madder and want to fight quicker than to lose
a kid.&#8221; Mr. Quince spoke in the tone of one accustomed
to hailing the main top in the midst of storm,
and his voice carried authoritative anxiety to the ears
of every mother.</p>

<p>A scene of confusion ensued. The dire prophecy of
the riverman caused each mother to seize her offspring
and press it to her breast. The infants, having expressed
acceptance of their new surroundings by falling
asleep, were disturbed and made known their objections
in loud wailings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who stirred up those babies?&#8221; Dr. Jackson demanded,
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; chorused the mothers, indicating the
worthy seafaring man. &#8220;He said that they would
get mixed up.&#8221; The hostile eyes of the matrons
watched Mr. Quince as if suspicious that he might attempt
personally to bring about the fulfillment of his
prediction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; shouted Dr. Jackson. &#8220;You mothers
ought to know your own babies by now, and, if you
don&#8217;t, you certainly know the clothes they have on.&#8221;</p>

<p>This assurance had a calming influence and quiet
was slowly restored. For a time Dr. Jackson appeared
about to reprimand the riverman, but hesitated, probably
fearful of again being placed on record.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince perceived the evidences of his personal
unpopularity with great coolness. Unabashed, he remarked,
&#8220;You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; all het up a layin&#8217; around here
with your kids. There&#8217;s nothing to it but a heap of
sweating. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, please,&#8221; begged Virginia. &#8220;I
think that some one else is coming. Won&#8217;t you blow
your whistle, Mr. Quince?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this request, real embarrassment descended upon
the skipper. After scratching his head reflectively,
he went aft to the engine room, or, more accurately,
climbed across to the rear barge and entered into conference
with Sim. After a period of argument and
persuasion, that young man took a slice bar and
pounded at the lever of the whistle. A great cloud of
steam hissed forth, from the midst of which came a
thin wailing note very like in volume those advertising
the presence of hot roasted peanuts.</p>

<p>Above the noise came a cry of &#8220;Whoa, hold on.&#8221;
Kelly, followed by Mr. Jones, gallantly guarding Miss
Knight, lest she inadvertently plunge headlong into the
waves below, descended from the bridge. The stenographer
was fittingly garbed for the occasion in flannel
trousers, silk shirt, serge coat and yachting cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go now, Mr. Quince,&#8221; cried Virginia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
making herself heard with difficulty above the roar of escaping
steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; yet awhile,&#8221; bellowed the commander
of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>. &#8220;The durned old whistle
is stuck and a lettin&#8217; all the steam out of the old biler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Jackson and Kelly repaired to the engine room
to inspect conditions. In a moment the medical man
returned, and, procuring his surgical case, hurried back
towards the hissing boiler.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s de fust time ah evah seed er Doctor called fo&#8217;
er enjine,&#8221; Ike told Serena. &#8220;Maybe it got de pip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It soun&#8217; mo&#8217;e lak de croup,&#8221; chuckled Serena.</p>

<p>With characteristic energy, the doctor applied a bandage
to the whistle which so confined the steam that
Sim was able, with sundry taps of a wrench, to abate
&#8220;the hemorrhage of vapor,&#8221; as the medical man termed
it.</p>

<p>There followed a pleasant period for friendly conversation,
disturbed only by the cries of infants, the
scrape of the shovel, and the clang of the furnace door.</p>

<p>During this time, the skipper sat on a box and pensively
viewed the slow movement of the needle of the
steam gauge. Finally he became energetic. Climbing
upon the bank, he cast off the forward hawser of
the <i>Nancy Jane</i>. Noting the eyes of the passengers
to be upon him, he assumed a care free air tinged with
a certain dignity, as if the handling of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>,
a perplexing problem to others, was a trifling matter
to him. Likewise, he entered into explanations, ostensibly
for Sim&#8217;s benefit. &#8220;I&#8217;ve cast off the bow line.
I&#8217;m agoin&#8217; to let the current swing er out, then we&#8217;ll
start ahead and you cast off that stern line.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>Before the eyes of the marveling mothers, Mr.
Quince assumed a position at the extreme front of the
boat, on a small deck beyond the railing. He held the
pole across his body, as the balancing stick of a tightrope
walker, and watched the current swing the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> away from the bank.</p>

<p>Sim waited, motionless as a statue, with a grimy
paw on the throttle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;er go,&#8221; sang Mr. Quince, as from the bridge
of the <i>Leviathan</i>, his powerful voice echoing against
the bluffs far up the river.</p>

<p>With much groaning and creaking the engine took
up the play of its gearing, and choked down with a
grunt as the paddles of the water wheel stuck in the
clay bank.</p>

<p>Seizing their babies, the mothers arose and screamed.
The infants also gave tongue.</p>

<p>As one man, Dr. Jackson and Kelly sprang to their
feet. &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; they shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is de biler gwine blow up?&#8221; Serena asked Ike,
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat ole enjine jes balky. Dat&#8217;s all,&#8221; he reassured
her.</p>

<p>In this moment of marine disaster, Mr. Quince displayed
great coolness and judgment. &#8220;Look out,&#8221; he
shouted to Sim, and leaped ashore with great agility.
From this position of vantage he commanded, &#8220;Stop
&#8217;er!&#8221; He then displayed wonderful presence of mind
by casting off the stern line. Returning on board, he
seized his pole and pushed the <i>Nancy Jane</i> out into
the river.</p>

<p>Once more, upon signal, the engine strained and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
large chunk of South Ridgefield soil splashed into the
river. The relieved paddle wheel caught the water
and the <i>Nancy Jane</i> headed up the Lame Moose for
Elgin&#8217;s Grove. Mr. Quince plied his pole diligently,
and, exerting his good muscles, shoved his craft into
the channel it should follow.</p>

<p>The journey to the Grove was accomplished without
notable incident. The sun shone upon the shallow
water at such an angle that Mr. Quince was able to
view the bottom of the river through the transparent
liquid as a pathway stretching before him.</p>

<p>During the voyage the heat was not oppressive, and
the infants slept while their mothers enjoyed a restful
holiday. This peace was threatened only when an
impromptu orchestra consisting of Sim on the harmonica
and Ike on a pair of improvised bones showed
a disposition to render some of the frivolous airs of
the moment for the edification of the ladies.</p>

<p>Elgin&#8217;s Grove lay cool and inviting as the <i>Nancy
Jane</i> stood in towards the shore. The shallowness of
the water made it necessary to reach the bank by a
narrow gang plank, thoughtfully provided by the steam
boat commander. As soon as this was in position,
Virginia led the party ashore where the farmer cordially
welcomed them with the original remark, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
you folks afraid you&#8217;re lost?&#8221; The supplies were
landed amidst much boisterous excitement by Kelly,
assisted by Mr. Quince, Sim and Ike.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones escorted Miss Knight ashore, bearing her
parasol. She joined Dr. Jackson and Virginia, who
were making plans for the general welfare.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mill owner&#8217;s daughter turned to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
stenographer and, smiling sweetly, said, &#8220;Mr. Jones,
may I depend upon you to see that the cots are brought
up from the boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones bowed with great dignity. &#8220;You will
always find me at your service, Miss Dale,&#8221; he responded,
in dulcet tones. The day was rosy to him.
The system of exercise, to which Kelly had unfeelingly
condemned him, was having its effect. He felt
better than he had for years. Likewise it appeared
that his dreams were coming true. That very morning
Obadiah had come to him and, in quite the approved
manner of addressing private secretaries, saving a certain
undue sharpness of tone, had said, &#8220;Jones, I wish
you and Kelly to accompany my daughter on a picnic
which she is giving today. The boat leaves the bridge
at ten o&#8217;clock, I believe.&#8221; Now, too, had his employer&#8217;s
daughter, aware of correct usages when private
secretaries were about, singled him by name to assist
her. It was of course to be regretted that this picnic
was charitable in its nature and attended only by vulgar
persons, but from the intimacy of such an occasion,
it was but a step to the dances and dinners of his heart&#8217;s
desire.</p>

<p>Filled with joy, Mr. Jones cast aside his coat and
ran across the greensward with the grace of a fawn.
He shouted for Kelly and Ike, and in a moment had
gathered about him the strong men of the party. He
issued his instructions in the terse, certain words of a
leader of men. Under his cheery encouragement, cots,
with a man at each end, moved rapidly from the boat
to their appointed place beneath the trees.</p>

<p>Perceiving the flushed face and the speed of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
stenographer&#8217;s movements, Virginia bestowed upon
him a glorious smile of approval and called, &#8220;Oh, Mr.
Jones, what a help you are to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The private secretary became proud nigh unto the
bursting point. He redoubled his efforts, and in a
moment all but the last cot was ashore. Kelly uplifted
the far end and bawled for aid.</p>

<p>Instantly, Mr. Jones was at hand to seize upon the
shore end of the cot. A leg caught upon a stanchion.
The stenographer jerked at it. &#8220;Get a move on you!&#8221;
he commanded Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, you cheese! What&#8217;s your hurry?&#8221; retorted
the bookkeeper, as he attempted to withdraw
the cot from the stanchion to release the leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; urged the strenuous Mr. Jones, turning
and facing Kelly. The leg was freed. &#8220;Hustle,
you big lobster! Can&#8217;t you lift your clumsy feet?&#8221;
persisted the driver of men.</p>

<p>Before this admonishment Kelly advanced with alacrity.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones moved backwards, blindly, but with haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; sounded Kelly&#8217;s warning; but alas,
too late.</p>

<p>In his hurry Mr. Jones missed the gang plank and
plunged backwards from the scow into three feet of
mud and water. The screams of frightened women
rent the air. A cry for the police arose from Mr.
Vivian, while from the lips of that seasoned sailor, Sim,
rang that terrifying cry, &#8220;Man overbo-o-o-ard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quince sprang into action at the alarm as a fireman
at the stroke of the gong. With a mighty leap
he landed on the bow of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>. Seizing his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
pole, he ran along the edge of the barge with the agility
of a cat towards the circling waves which alone marked
where the private secretary had disappeared. Mr.
Quince reached forth tentatively with his pole, as Mr.
Jones, having scrambled to his knees beneath the flood,
emerged coughing and scrambling from the water.</p>

<p>The head of Mr. Jones came up, the pole of Mr.
Quince went down. They met.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wough!</i>&#8221; The stenographer lifted his voice in
anguish and seated himself upon the river bottom, his
head protruding above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Undiscouraged, Mr. Quince, with practiced hand,
continued to seek for Mr. Jones with the iron hook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get off of me with that thing. It hurts,&#8221; protested
the moist private secretary.</p>

<p>Regardless of these objections from his victim, Mr.
Quince would have persisted in his efforts with a diligence
certain of reward had not Kelly reached down
from the bank, and, seizing the dripping and miserable
stenographer by the hand, pulled him ashore.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince desisted from his fishing operations only
when his prey was beyond his reach. Turning to Ike
who had regarded his life saving with profound approval,
he boasted, &#8220;I&#8217;d a got him by the britches sure,
if he hadn&#8217;t a bin a settin&#8217; down.&#8221; He rested upon
his pole and his eagle eye swept the river, flashing brilliant
in the sunshine. Into his face, but recently
lighted with enthusiasm, came a look of dissatisfaction,
of disappointment, as he confided his woe to the chauffeur.
&#8220;There hain&#8217;t nobody ever gits drownded in
the old Lame Moose,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;Hain&#8217;t
&#8217;nough water to drownd a weasel.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>To Ike came comprehension of the troubled soul of
the river-man, and he endeavored to comfort him.
&#8220;Dey am&#8217; &#8217;nough water in dis yere river to slac&#8217; de
thirst o&#8217; er g&#8217;asshopper,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>Loud conversation took place among the mothers as
Dr. Jackson announced his purpose of serving sustenance
to those infants whose habit it was to resort
to artificial sources for nourishment. Much attention
was given to the sterilization of bottles, the
measuring of milk, and the addition of lime water
thereto. The medical man took the opportunity to
deliver a lecture upon the feeding of infants with some
reference to their early care and discipline, and Virginia
took base advantage of her position as picnic
manager to hold the babies while they enjoyed bottled
refreshments. She would have also kissed each recipient
of her favor had she not been sternly repressed
by Dr. Jackson, much to the amusement of Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the child kiss the babies if she wants to, Doctor,&#8221;
urged the widow.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he refused with firmness. &#8220;Kissing is dangerous.
Now that we have prohibition, if we could
get rid of smoking and kissing, things would be about
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you engaged, Doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not. What made you ask me that,
Mrs. Henderson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why I did, myself, Doctor. It was a
foolish question.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the close of the infantile banquet, the mothers
returned their offspring to the line of cots, where,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
protected by mosquito netting, they straightway relapsed
into slumber.</p>

<p>Kelly, who had returned alone from the depths of
the woods into which he had departed with the dripping
Mr. Jones, was greatly interested, and addressed Miss
Knight. &#8220;Watch those kids pound their ears! They
sure eat sleep as soon as they hit the hay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse looked at the bookkeeper inquiringly.
&#8220;What are you? Wop, Guiney, Polock or Sheeny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must hate the English language. I thought
that you must be foreign.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were dancing when he looked at her and
said, &#8220;My name is Kelly, Miss Knight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That explains it,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>The bachelor farmer who owned the grove watched
the pleasant scene from a seat upon the well curb.
Resting upon the damp planking, he philosophically
sucked upon a black pipe, and gave ear to the prevalent
wisdom on baby feeding. He modified this, no doubt,
in his own mind, in the light of his own experience
as a successful stock feeder.</p>

<p>With that social spirit always noticeable in his character,
Ike joined the agriculturist and entered into casual
conversation. &#8220;Dis is er fine grove you got yere,
Misto Elgin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s by long odds the best grove on the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;r.&#8221; The chat languished until reopened by
Ike on other lines. &#8220;You has er fine view, Misto Elgin,
an&#8217; you has got fine trees an&#8217; you has got fine aiah.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer chuckled. &#8220;If you&#8217;d a bin &#8217;round here
yesterday afternoon when I cleaned out the well I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
bet the air would have made you sick at your stomach,
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How cum?&#8221; Ike demanded sharply, his eyes rolling
white with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old hole was full of dead reptiles and varmints.
I got a skunk, a rabbit, two frogs and three snakes
out and a couple of things so far gone I couldn&#8217;t tell &#8217;em.
Gorry but they stunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You &#8217;spec&#8217; dey mek dat water bad?&#8221; pleaded Ike,
in a voice pathetic in its intenseness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Water with things like that in it is deadly pizen,
I cal&#8217;late,&#8221; the farmer told him, with a shudder at his
own repulsive memories.</p>

<p>Ike leaped to his feet hurriedly. Fear lifted him
&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, Sar,&#8221; he murmured, as if he had been suddenly
taken ill. A moment later, discovering the medical
man resting in the shade of a great tree, the negro
approached him with an air of indifference tempered
with respect. For all that he knew this might be a
dreaded &#8220;night doctor&#8221;&#8211;one of those fearful beings
who steal about in the late hours of the night despoiling
sepulchers and seizing late strollers for the benefit
of science. It is obviously unwise to irritate such
characters, lest evil befall one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis is er fine day, Doc,&#8221; Ike suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doc, do pizen hit er man suddin?&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician glanced lazily at the negro. The spirit
of mischief seized him. &#8220;Look here, boy,&#8221; he cried,
in a threatening manner, &#8220;I warn you as a friend as
well as a medical man to keep away from poison. You
are so tough, so ornery, so low down good for nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
and lazy, that poison would have to work slow under
your hide and you would die a lingering and painful
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word Ike departed. The verdict
had been handed down and sentence passed. Before
him lay a dreadful death. He sought solitude in which
to pass his few remaining hours and to prepare for
his fearful end. Stumbling along, he came upon the
ice cream freezers and the lunch baskets. Serena and
Mr. Vivian sat among them, engaged in debate regarding
the preparation of certain types of cake in view
of the high cost of eggs.</p>

<p>To Ike&#8217;s mind, this was the kitchen. His home, his
place of retirement, should logically be back of this.
Within him burned increasing fear. Upon self-examination,
he discovered that peculiar symptoms beset
every part of his body. Unquestionably the fatal
hour approached. The time of paroxysms and fits
was at hand. Trembling and almost blind from apprehension,
the chauffeur circled the refreshments and
the culinary argument. He came upon a shady nook.
The tall brush had been pulled aside and fashioned
into a rude canopy which, with the tree branches overhead,
afforded a double protection from the sun.
Within it, his confused eyes made out that which appeared
a couch decked forth with old blankets and
gunny sacks. Ike sank upon this with a moan of anguish
and, with his kinky head buried in the crook of
his elbow, awaited the final agony which would herald
the passing of his soul.</p>

<p>With that love for solitude and self-communion, so
common to unusual minds, Mr. Quince had not mingled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
with the ladies. While technically a member of the
picnic party, he was not one with it in spirit, in taste or
in aspiration. Those who go down to the sea in ships
give but little heed to infant culture. Therefore, he
strolled about the circumference of the festivities instead
of in their midst and thus came upon the recumbent
Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; he demanded in the
rough manner of a man hardened by contact with nature
in her wildest moods.</p>

<p>Ike emitted a dismal groan.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince, ever one of action, promptly applied that
treatment deemed peculiarly efficacious in the treatment
of those intoxicated. He seized the negro by his
shoulders and shook him violently. &#8220;Come up!&#8221; he
roared. &#8220;Git a move on yer, yer lazy bum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemme go!&#8221; protested Ike, astounded at the administration
of such radical restorative measures to
one about to shuffle off. &#8220;Ah&#8217;m er dead man. Ah&#8217;m
er gwine to pass away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quince registered intense interest. &#8220;Yer don&#8217;t
say?&#8221; He scratched his head reflectively and brought
the cold light of reason to bear upon the problem.
&#8220;Whatcher talkin&#8217; about,&#8221; he went on in tones of regret.
&#8220;Yer hain&#8217;t dead&#8221;; and concluded more hopefully,
&#8220;Leastways not yit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;p,&#8221; moaned Ike, apparently in intense agony.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince pensively spat a stream of tobacco juice
across the bier of the dying one. &#8220;Maybe that doctor
mought give yer some dope,&#8221; he suggested, with
great deliberation.</p>

<p>Ike&#8217;s answer was a sepulchral groan.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>Dr. Jackson, with the utmost possible composure
was receiving from a group of mothers that feminine
adulation usually accorded the members of his profession.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince slowly approached them. &#8220;That black
boy is er dying over there,&#8221; he hailed, as an officer ex-changing
casual greetings from his bridge with a passing
ship.</p>

<p>The doctor leaped to his feet with a startled look.
So did the mothers as well as every one else who was
sitting down. They moved in a body to the side of
the expiring chauffeur. About his couch they grouped,
as it is painted that courts gather by the bedside of
expiring monarchs to receive the royal farewell.</p>

<p>Before the assembled multitude, Ike moaned and
groaned in anguish of mind and body.</p>

<p>Dr. Jackson examined him. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah done drink poison,&#8221; Ike whined. &#8220;De col&#8217;
chills is er runnin&#8217; down ma back an&#8217; ma laigs. Ah&#8217;s
gwine ter die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Serena drew near. Her extensive acquaintance with
the young man made her skeptical in all things concerning
him. She examined his surroundings with
interest and cried, &#8220;Ef dat fool ain&#8217; got no bettah
sense an&#8217; to lay hisse&#8217;f out on ma ice why ain&#8217; he got
col&#8217; chills?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lifting a sack, Dr. Jackson exposed the smooth surface
of a block of ice.</p>

<p>Ike sprang from his chilly couch.</p>

<p>Serena made indignant outcry. &#8220;Howcum yo&#8217;all
mek er coolin&#8217; boa&#8217;d out er ma ice when ah needs it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
fo&#8217; lemonade? Ah fin&#8217; out mighty quick ef you is er
dyin&#8217; when ah surves de fried chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disgust developed among the mothers; but Ike took
no note of popular feeling. His was the joy of a reprieved
man as his pains flew away before the reassuring
laughter of the medical man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have something to eat,&#8221; suggested the
chuckling practitioner, when he had completed this cure
by faith.</p>

<p>As if by magic, the luncheon was spread, and how
those blissfully contented mothers did eat and make the
woods ring with the merriment of their holiday. The
fun was given greater impetus by the reappearance of
Mr. Jones who, pending the drying of his own more
luxurious apparel, was clothed in garments of rural
simplicity loaned by the farmer.</p>

<p>Embarrassment spoke from every feature of the
stenographer as, in the midst of laughter, he approached
the festive spread.</p>

<p>Virginia perceived his sad case and beckoned him
to her side. &#8220;Here is Mr. Jones,&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;He suffered for the cause and shall be our guest of
honor.&#8221; With her own hands she arranged a place for
him and saw that he had food enough for two men.
This she made sweeter with smiles of approval and
appreciation.</p>

<p>The private secretary said but little. Yet the day
became beautiful, and once again joy rested in his
heart.</p>

<p>In the coolness of Elgin&#8217;s grove, the afternoon of
the hottest day South Ridgefield ever experienced
passed lazily. The mothers chatted and laughed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
some took naps; but best of all the babies ate and slept
in comfortable rotation as the hot hours passed.</p>

<p>Upon repeated urgings by Mr. Quince the tired
party re-embarked upon the <i>Nancy Jane</i> after supper.
The riverman explained gloomily, &#8220;I hain&#8217;t got no use
for this old river after dark. The government hain&#8217;t
hangin&#8217; no lanterns on the snags in the Lame Moose,
and I hain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to steer by but the lightnin&#8217;
bugs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of the skipper&#8217;s attitude, the departure
was delayed because a postprandial nap of Sim&#8217;s had
allowed the steam to get low while the commanding
officer persuaded the passengers to return aboard.</p>

<p>Becoming aware of this condition, rough language
was used abaft the beam, as the Captain addressed the
crew. Mutiny was evidently rampant, as the crew
was heard to invite the Captain to return home on foot
if dissatisfied with its efforts. Then came arbitration,
and, after a time, above the noise of argument, the
hissing of steam sounded in increasing volume.</p>

<p>The shadows of night lay upon the waters as the
<i>Nancy Jane</i> left Elgin&#8217;s Grove. Since it was too dark
for the navigator to procure his accustomed view of
the river bottom, he peered into the gloom with anxious
eyes. Upon the banks the tops of the trees showed
clear against the evening sky; but the shadowy mass
below was of a nature to baffle the judgment of all but
the most experienced pilots.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince was not baffled. He laid the <i>Nancy Jane</i>
upon a course down the middle of the stream, and,
laying aside the tiller, he retired to the engine room
where, in a voice which reached every ear upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
lightless deck, he conversed with the engineer regarding
the more intimate details of navigation. &#8220;How
much steam have you got on the old tea pot?&#8221; he
asked, and when Sim told him, complained, &#8220;That
hain&#8217;t enough to make this yere turtle crawl home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all this leaky kettle kin hold,&#8221; objected the engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince made technical explanations. &#8220;Steam
is a blowin&#8217; out of the safety valve. That&#8217;s where yer
air losin&#8217; power. I cal&#8217;late the old flat iron is er slippin&#8217;.
I&#8217;ll fix &#8217;er.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shuffling of feet sounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How kin you tell where you are a-puttin&#8217; that flat
iron?&#8221; protested Sim. &#8220;You&#8217;re a goin&#8217; to bust the
darned oil biler a foolin&#8217; with that valve in the dark.
You can&#8217;t see what you&#8217;re doin&#8217; no more than a mole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t slipped &#8217;er out er notch. She&#8217;s where she
orter be. This biler hain&#8217;t er goin&#8217; to blow up.
What&#8217;s it to yer any way; it hain&#8217;t your biler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I got to stand by the blame thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; on yer?&#8221; asked Mr. Quince, a trifle
obscurely. &#8220;Yer know dern well you&#8217;re too blame
lazy to shovel enough coal under the old wash biler
to git her het up none before we git home.&#8221;</p>

<p>This struck Sim as reasonable. He changed the
subject and inquired, &#8220;Where are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>A voice remarkably like that of Mr. Quince, although
it could not have been that experienced river man, responded,
&#8220;I dunno.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaves rustled along the roof, and the skipper departed
hurriedly for his post or, more accurately, his
pole. For a time he wielded it energetically. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
current was assisting the engine and so they moved
fairly rapidly. The glow of South Ridgefield showed
above the trees, and, with ever greater frequency, the
lights of scattered houses gleamed upon either bank.
They passed the suburbs. Upon either shore lay dark
masses of manufacturing plants lighted by isolated electric
lights. They were abreast of Obadiah Dale&#8217;s mill
now, while a short block away stretched the ghostly
fabric of the highway bridge, dimly traced by its own
arch of lights. Beneath it was their landing place; so
the mothers began to prepare to land and to thank Virginia
for their pleasant day.</p>

<p>Mr. Quince, of course, was at his post. Resting
himself upon his pole, he was enjoying that satisfaction
over duty well performed which abides in the
breasts of ships&#8217; captains and locomotive engineers
when they bring their passengers to a safe journey&#8217;s
end.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bow of the <i>Nancy Jane</i> rose slowly
and imperceptibly. There was a sizzling, grinding
sound, and the boat stopped abruptly but softly as
against a cushion, aground on a sand bar. As the
craft struck there was a forward movement upon her
deck, and a shifting of passengers and freight. A
resounding splash sounded in front of the wrecked
vessel. Mr. Quince, resting meditatively upon the
pole, had been, sad to relate, hove over the bow of his
own ship. At the moment of his departure he gave a
diabolical yell.</p>

<p>A scene of terror ensued. Mothers sending forth
wild screams hugged their babes to their bosoms as
they faced the unknown perils of the night. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
were not made calmer by a rhythmic heaving of the
deck, accompanied by a mighty boiling and beating of
the water astern, as the paddle wheel exerted itself
against the sand bar. Perhaps Sim wished to emulate
&#8220;Jim Bludso&#8221; of heroic fame, and, in the absence of
his pilot, keep the engine going &#8220;to hold her nozzle
agin the bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>With soothing and calming words, Kelly and Dr.
Jackson finally brought a partial calm when panic
seemed assured.</p>

<p>At the first alarm, Ike had leaped up from a box
upon which he had been resting from the labors of
the day. With rare presence of mind, Mr. Jones
seized it for personal use as a life preserver in case of
need. Reassured by the remoteness of danger, Ike
endeavored to sit where no seat was, and, with a
crash, measured his length upon the deck. This episode
did not tend to allay the nervousness of female
minds.</p>

<p>From the shadows of the night, a dripping figure
scrambled over the bow of the ship. It was Mr. Quince
returning from whence he had been hove. He reassumed
command. &#8220;Stop the engine!&#8221; he squeaked,
in a voice made husky by too much moisture. &#8220;Want
to burn all the coal up for nothin&#8217;?&#8221; Obediently the
engine slowed and stopped. Again the voice of the
skipper sang out, &#8220;Better fix that old safety valve.
I mought a shoved &#8217;er too far in the dark.&#8221; Suddenly
a tremendous hissing of steam arose and then
died softly away. Mr. Quince hurried to the engine
room and addressed Sim at close quarters. &#8220;Yer
dern fool, what made yer let all the steam outer the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
biler. We hain&#8217;t got no power now. How&#8217;re we
goin&#8217; to git &#8217;er off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to git &#8217;er off. She&#8217;s stuck for
good,&#8221; prophesied Sim.</p>

<p>It is not easy to discourage great spirits. &#8220;Ef I
can&#8217;t git &#8217;er off now, I kin wait for high water. The
old tub hain&#8217;t hurt none,&#8221; Mr. Quince made answer.</p>

<p>Basing the duration of their experience as castaways
upon these remarks, the mothers gave away to tears.
Babies awakened and wept also. A chorus of woe
swept shoreward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows how to swim?&#8221; Dr. Jackson asked
in a sharp voice.</p>

<p>The ladies construed this remark as implying an
early necessity for this accomplishment. The resulting
increase in grief was with difficulty subdued.</p>

<p>From the information educed, it was clear that Sim
was among the most experienced swimmer among
those present. Being untrammeled by the mandates
of fearful females, he had since his early youth spent
much of the summer season in the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sim, you swim ashore and get help,&#8221; ordered the
doctor.</p>

<p>A difficulty arose, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; to swim with my
clothes on,&#8221; objected Sim. &#8220;Maybe I only have to
wade, but I might get into a hole and have to swim.
Clothes drag a feller down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very sensible,&#8221; agreed the physician. &#8220;Take
them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t no heathen. I ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to take my
clothes off before all of these womenfolks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; urged the doctor. &#8220;We will turn
our heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take &#8217;em off behind the biler,&#8221; suggested Mr.
Quince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, fry myself on the durned old thing.&#8221; Additional
complications struck the youth. &#8220;What am
I goin&#8217; to wear when I git ashore. The cops will git
me sure, if I run around town naked.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last, a compromise was reached. Sim, simply
attired in trousers, disappeared towards the shore.
Then followed a long period of silence in which the
babies slept in comfort and only the sobbing mothers
were unhappy.</p>

<p>Voices sounded on the shore. Sim had carried the
news of shipwreck to waiting husbands and succor
drew near. They built a fire and shouted words of
encouragement. A search was made for boats; but
they were few in South Ridgefield and well protected
from marauders. Even the only seaworthy skiff of
Mr. Quince&#8217;s fleet was securely locked, and the key
in his pocket, as Sim reminded him from the shore.</p>

<p>The night wore on. Great activity with little result
took place about the fire. Policemen, firemen and
newspapermen viewed the scene with interest. Such
prominent men as Obadiah Dale and Hezekiah Wilkins
exchanged ideas over the fire with factory employees
and laborers. It was Pat Murphy, a teamster, who
solved the problem of rescue. As the eastern sky was
lighted by the first streaks of the coming day, a mule
team and a wagon in a few trips landed the passengers
of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>.</p>

<p>In accordance with the traditions of the sea, Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
Quince stayed by his ship. The last load departed
leaving him drying himself before the furnace. The
reflection of the fire lighted up the deep lines of his
face, its pensive look and the rhythmic movement of
the powerful jaws, as the faithful mariner kept vigil
upon the waters.</p>

<p>But, as the rays of the rising sun turned the eastern
horizon into gold, an early observer might have perceived
Mr. Quince arise, stretch himself, and solace his
palate with chewing tobacco. The same beholder might
then have witnessed the riverman step overboard and
wade slowly towards the shore, bearing his shoes,
wrapped in his trousers, before him, while the morning
breeze flapped the tails of his old flannel shirt about
his thin legs.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A MAN IN DISGRACE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Virginia, come here!&#8221; roared Obadiah on the
morning after the trip up the river.</p>

<p>There was a rough commanding note in his voice
which made the girl spring to her feet, and, shaken
by dread of impending calamity, with throbbing heart
and startled eyes, hurry down stairs to where he
awaited her in the living room.</p>

<p>He stood before the great mantel. The morning
paper was stretched between his hands, his nervous
fingers crushing its edges. His face was flushed with
passion and his eyes, as they met those of his daughter,
were cruel in their anger. &#8220;Look here! See
what you have done,&#8221; he cried, in a voice which shook
with the intenseness of his emotion. In his haste he
tore a corner from the paper as he thrust it towards the
trembling girl.</p>

<p>She accepted the sheet as if she were in a dream.
Never had he spoken so to her. Never had she seen
him in such a rage. Fear of him&#8211;of the primitive
masculinity of the man&#8211;clutched at her heart.
Everything seemed unreal. It was as if she were in
the midst of a horrible nightmare from which she
might, if she would, release herself. She sank into
a chair, the paper across her knees. As her eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
dropped, the print danced queerly for a moment before
her vision cleared. There, she read in staring
headlines, &#8220;The Wreck of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The comical side of the vicissitudes of the <i>Nancy
Jane</i>, with its passenger list of mothers and babies had
so impressed the reporter that he had prepared his story
in a humorous vein. Unfortunately, he had elected to
weave his story about Obadiah Dale, the manufacturer,
and his daughter, instead of about Mrs. Henderson or
any humble individual. The story was funny. The
way the scribbler linked the generosity of Obadiah towards
the babies, the navigation of the Lame Moose
by the <i>Nancy Jane</i>, and Elgin&#8217;s Grove, was a scream to
those who knew the selfishness of the mill owner, the
shallow depth and harmlessness of the Lame Moose
and the lurid history of the grove. The editor-owner
of the paper had little use for Obadiah and in running
this article&#8211;good natured and harmless on its face&#8211;he
had hit the manufacturer in a vulnerable spot.
Obadiah could not stand ridicule.</p>

<p>While Virginia read, the wide toed shoes of her father
resounded, as he tramped excitedly up and down
the room. She finished the article and looked up at
him. Little chills of fright thrilled up and down her
spine, and yet she found no reason for it in the column
she had been reading. That struck her as rather silly.</p>

<p>As she dropped the paper, Obadiah glowered down
at her. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he yelled, in his high voice, &#8220;I hope
that you are satisfied. You have made me the laughing
stock of this town&#8211;made a perfect ass out of
me.&#8221; He shook a long forefinger at her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve stood
enough of your foolishness and it&#8217;s got to stop.&#8221; The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
old man was nearly frantic with anger as he scowled
at her, a pale, crushed little thing in the big arm chair.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of it,&#8221; he raged. &#8220;You make me ridiculous
by your failure to appreciate that there is such a
thing as personal dignity. You&#8217;ve mixed me in the
most nonsensical affairs. Think of it! Parading
down the main street of this town behind a minstrel
band with a load of negroes!&#8221; He almost gnashed
his teeth at the thought. &#8220;You got up that fool band
concert at the Old Ladies&#8217; Home. It was a farce with
the fire department dashing up in the middle of it.
Now,&#8221; he bellowed, &#8220;you had to go and get mixed in
this mess on the river.&#8221; Obadiah had to pause in the
catalogue of his grievances to catch his breath. His
temper was choking him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always tried to protect
my reputation,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve minded my
business and let other people attend to theirs. But you
have to drag me into this. My name is a hiss and a
byword in this town today. I&#8217;ll never hear the last of
it. You are to blame for it all.&#8221; Self-pity brought
Obadiah to the verge of tears.</p>

<p>But immediately a returning wave of anger engulfed
his sorrow. &#8220;You are extravagant&#8211;wickedly so.
You force me to pay out large sums of money.
You&#8217;ve made me buy ice cream for the old ladies, the
veterans, the firemen and all the mothers and babies,
too.&#8211;Pretty nearly the whole town has been entertained
at my expense,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;Worst of all,&#8221;
he continued with renewed temper, &#8220;were your fool
admissions and asinine agreement which forced me to
endow that room at the hospital.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to call a halt,&#8221; he raved. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
no longer. It must stop.&#8221; He paused before the
shrinking girl and shook his fist in the air. &#8220;Hereafter
you will mind your own business and not interfere
in the troubles of others. You&#8217;ll stay at home
where you belong and quit gadding about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stunned by his vehemence and crushed by his words,
the forlorn little figure raised pleading eyes to him
as he strode out of the room. &#8220;Daddy,&#8221; she cried
after him, but he took no notice of it.</p>

<p>In her own room, tears brought relief to Virginia,
and in time she was able to review her father&#8217;s behavior
with a degree of calmness. She trembled anew as she
remembered his anger. Then, with a start, she awakened
to the fact that he had forbidden her to continue
to do those things which she had done in the spirit of
her mother&#8217;s message. Her mind traveled over his
actions in the past and reconsidered remarks that he
had made. Suddenly she realized that he had never
been in sympathy with her, that he had frankly told her
so, and that she had refused to believe him. With
sickening alarm, she awakened to the conflict between
the ideals of her father and her mother. She sat upon
the bed, a dejected heap of sorrow, and gazed at the
wall with dry eyes, frightened and unseeing. What
must she do? That was the question. It smothered
her acute grief at his angry words. Worshiping the
mother whom she had never known with all the hunger
of a lonely heart, it was a solemn and tragic decision
which she forced upon herself. The gravity of it
urged her to physical action. She could not bear to
lie there, she must move about.</p>

<p>It was a sad eyed girl who went downstairs. From
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
Serena she learned that her father had telephoned that
he would not be home for lunch.</p>

<p>The old negress used all of her arts to persuade her
mistress to eat something. &#8220;Ain&#8217; yo&#8217;all gwine pick at
dis yere salad an&#8217; tast&#8217;tes some o&#8217; de custard ah fix
special fo&#8217; ma honey chil&#8217;?&#8221; she begged. To comfort
Virginia she belittled the episode of the morning.
&#8220;You&#8217; Daddy done git mad fo&#8217; er minute caze dat ole
boat stick in de mud. He gwine fo&#8217;git it quick. He
ain&#8217; tek no &#8217;count o&#8217; de babies wot &#8217;joy deyse&#8217;fs er
eatin&#8217; an&#8217; er sleepin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl ate sparingly as Serena forced food upon
her.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old servant reached out and patted her
mistress gently upon the shoulder, her black face filled
with a great tenderness as she said, &#8220;You&#8217; Mammy
done say, ef er pusson try to do right, dey ain&#8217; nothin&#8217;
else wot mek no diffe&#8217;nce. Dat&#8217;s jes wot Miss Elinor
she say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m, she done say dat right befo&#8217; ma eyes,&#8221;
explained Serena, and then she hastened away to answer
the door bell, leaving Virginia gazing dreamily
out of a window, wonderfully comforted.</p>

<p>The shrill voice of a woman uplifted in excitement
sounded in the hall. &#8220;We must see some one. We
have come a long distance and Mr. Dale is not at his
office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey ain&#8217; nobody heah fo&#8217; yo&#8217;all to talk no business
to. You might jes as well go &#8217;long,&#8221; Serena answered
with firmness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dale has a daughter,&#8221; the voice suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217; gwine be &#8217;sturbed. She jes er chil&#8217; an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
ain&#8217; know nothin&#8217; a tall &#8217;bout her pappy&#8217;s business.
Bettah gwan away f&#8217;om heah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Serena?&#8221; asked Virginia, hurrying into
the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jes some pussons dat ain&#8217; know whar dey &#8217;long,&#8221;
snarled the old negress, beginning to vibrate under the
stress of anger as she glared at three highly indignant
women waiting without.</p>

<p>Virginia felt that it was necessary to interfere in the
tense situation. &#8220;I am Miss Dale. I shall be glad
to talk to you if you wish to come in,&#8221; she told the
strangers, to Serena&#8217;s disgust.</p>

<p>The hostility of these visitors melted in a degree at
this display of hospitality; but their manner was cool
as they followed the girl into the living room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are a committee from the Women&#8217;s Civic Club
of Amity, a town situated ten miles below here on the
river,&#8221; explained Mrs. Duncan, a stern faced female,
after they had introduced themselves. &#8220;We ask that
you inform your father of our call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to do that,&#8221; Virginia promised.
&#8220;Am I to explain the purpose of your visit to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Duncan gazed questioningly at the girl. &#8220;We
ask you to do that, and if you have a heart we hope
that you will use your influence in our behalf. You
may tell him&#8211;&#8221; her eyes blazed&#8211;&#8220;that we come on
the part of the women of Amity to protest against his
killing us by putting poison in our drinking water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; gasped an astonished Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t propose to sit quiet and allow Obadiah
Dale to murder our children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>The very evident amazement and horror of the mill
owner&#8217;s daughter at her words caused Mrs. Duncan to
expand upon them in the cause of clearness. &#8220;Amity
gets its water supply from the Lame Moose River,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;The waste from your father&#8217;s mill has
made the water unfit for human consumption. It has
been getting worse for years and now we have much
sickness, especially among children, which the doctors
trace to this cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that is terrible. I am sure that my father
knows nothing about it,&#8221; cried Virginia with great
earnestness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duncan gave an audible sniff of disbelief.
&#8220;Oh, I think that he does. We tried to get him to do
something before we took the matter up with the State
Board of Health, but he wouldn&#8217;t. They have taken
samples of the water and have decided that the waste
makes it unfit for the use of human beings. So that is
settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is true why don&#8217;t they take the matter up
with my father? Why should you come to him?&#8221;
asked Virginia, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Mrs. Duncan continued, &#8220;your father
is rich and powerful, and even if the Board of Health
orders him to stop running waste into the river he may
take the matter into court and fight it for years. That
is what we are worrying about now. Must Amity go
on drinking poisoned water while your father and the
Board of Health fight in the court? Our purpose is
to attempt to persuade him not to contest the decision of
the Board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my father is certain that the waste from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
mill is making people sick, he surely will stop running
it into the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the only decent thing for him to do,&#8221; agreed
Mrs. Duncan, greatly mollified by the attitude of the
girl. &#8220;Perhaps the Board of Health has not notified
him of its final decision,&#8221; she conceded. &#8220;Of course
our Club is greatly interested and we have kept in close
touch with the case. Our representatives have called
frequently at the office of the Board.&#8221; She laughed.
&#8220;We even had a committee which used to go with Mr.
Joe Curtis, the Board&#8217;s representative, every time he
took samples of water at Amity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who took the samples?&#8221; asked Virginia, instantly
alert.</p>

<p>&#8220;A young man by the name of Curtis. He used to
come out on a motorcycle. He worked for the Board
of Health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the matter up with my father, tonight,&#8221;
Virginia promised the women when they left. &#8220;You
can be sure that he will do the right thing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her old confidence in her father surged up in the
presence of the callers; but after they had gone the remembrance
of the morning&#8217;s episode, with her new
realization of her father, persisted in returning. She
caught herself wondering if it were possible that he,
knowing that the waste from his mill was polluting
the water and causing sickness, had done nothing about
it. Loyally she fought back the thought. He
wouldn&#8217;t do that&#8211;a wicked thing. He didn&#8217;t know
the truth&#8211;if the water <i>was</i> bad. That was the point.
Before she talked to him she ought to be certain about
it. Joe Curtis knew and could tell her the truth. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
father, hearing it from her, would be glad to do the
right thing.</p>

<p>Yet, regardless of her hopeful reasoning, the memories
of the morning&#8211;of her father&#8217;s temper torn face
in all of its selfish cruelty of expression&#8211;came back
to her and filled her with strange indefinite forebodings
of evil.</p>

<p>So, it was a different Virginia who came to Joe Curtis
that afternoon. It was one in whose face there
were vague shadows of anxiety and sadness which, regardless
of pathetic efforts at disguise, spoke of an
unquiet heart.</p>

<p>He sensed the change in her as she greeted him. But
his cheery salutation and his boyish bursts of humor
could not arouse the care free girl whom he had
known.</p>

<p>She came quickly to the matter which was uppermost
in her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, you work for the State Board of Health,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>His face sobered at her question, as if he recognized
the approach of complications. He nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You took samples of the river water to find out if
it were made unfit for people to drink by the waste
from my father&#8217;s mill, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He delayed his response so long that she was forced
to repeat her question before she could get even a nod
of admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, does my father&#8217;s mill spoil the water?&#8221;</p>

<p>His head moved uneasily upon his pillow; but he
was silent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>&#8220;Please answer me,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;It is very important.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned upon her almost shortly. &#8220;How can I
tell? I never analyzed the water. I couldn&#8217;t do it if
I wanted to. You know that I am working my way
through college. I have only had one year of chemistry.
On the rolls of the Board of Health, I am carried
as a laborer. I get samples and certify to the
time and place I took them. The laboratory analyzes
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were around the laboratory. You brought
in the samples. Naturally you must have had some
interest in the matter&#8211;in your work. Won&#8217;t you
tell me what you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ask me?&#8221; he complained sharply. &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t discuss this matter with you, Virginia. Talk
to your father. He knows all about the case. Let
him tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father knows!&#8221; she exclaimed. She leaned
over the bed and gazed down at him. Though she had
guessed his answer, she must have it in words. &#8220;Joe,&#8221;
she whispered, &#8220;you promised to be my friend. I
must know the truth. I can trust you. Please tell me
about the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pathetic pleading in her eyes which tore
at his heart. He tried to resist the spell she cast about
him but his face softened beneath her gaze. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, little girl,&#8221; he whispered, and then blurted suddenly,
&#8220;Everybody connected with the Board of Health
knows that the waste makes the water fierce. It&#8217;s not
fit for a dog to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon Obadiah arrived home early.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
Perhaps he meant to patch up a peace with his daughter.
He asked for her as soon as he entered the house and
seemed disappointed when he learned that she had
gone out.</p>

<p>Virginia came back from the hospital soon after the
arrival of her father. Serena met her when she arrived,
after having viewed her employer with great
hostility through an opening in the portières. The old
negress&#8217; eyes were keen enough to read the shadow
of apprehension lurking in the depths of the blue eyes.
To the faithful servitor it indicated the approach of
sorrow or tragedy to this peaceful domestic haven.
She sought to intervene against fate. &#8220;Ain&#8217; you
bettah res&#8217; youse&#8217;f befo&#8217; dinner, honey chil&#8217;? You&#8217;
Daddy, he&#8217;s a readin&#8217; his papah an&#8217; ain&#8217; want to be
&#8217;sturbed,&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>There was determination in the girl&#8217;s face. She
pushed aside the black hand which in kindness would
have detained her. &#8220;No, Serena, I must see him at
once,&#8221; she said, and passed on into the living room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Virginia. Where have you been hiding
yourself?&#8221; was her father&#8217;s friendly greeting, but he
gave her a sharp glance.</p>

<p>She sat down as she told him. &#8220;I have been to the
hospital, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s face hardened and he scanned the page
before him.</p>

<p>She watched his movements with unconcealed
anxiety. She was very pale and it was only with an
effort that she could calm herself to say, &#8220;A committee
of ladies from Amity came to see you this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>&#8220;What did any committee of women want with
me? Money?&#8221; he suggested, with a suspicious eye
upon his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they came, they said, because the waste from
the mill is spoiling the river water and causing sickness
in their town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they come to my office about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did, but you were not in.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shifted uneasily in his chair. &#8220;Did you talk to
them about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. They explained the matter to me. They
said that the Board of Health has found that the water
is unfit to drink. They wanted to persuade you not
to go into court about the decision. A law suit might
last for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed harshly. &#8220;They are waking up, are
they? They thought that they could scare me with
the Board of Health. Did you say anything to
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Daddy, I told them that if you were assured
that the waste from your mill was making people sick
you would stop running it into the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a crackling sound as he crushed the paper
in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Daddy,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I was careful to
make the point that you could not be expected to do
anything unless you were sure that it was the waste
from your mills which was responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah leaped to his feet. A smile of relief swept
over his face. &#8220;You caught the point exactly, dear.
How do I know that my mill is responsible for the
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>She did not respond to his change of mood but continued,
&#8220;The ladies assured me that the Board of
Health, after a careful investigation, has decided that
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>She looked up at the change in his tone. His manner
seemed to make her more resolute as she spoke
again. &#8220;The matter was so important that I wanted
to be sure that you knew the truth about it.&#8221; Her
voice was trembling now. &#8220;I went to the hospital and
asked Mr. Curtis. It was he who took the samples of
water for the Board of Health, and I knew that he
would tell me the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded Obadiah, his voice pitched
high.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked him if the waste from your mill made the
water bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well of all the preposterous interferences&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe said that it wasn&#8217;t fit for a dog to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that booby know about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As he works for the Board of Health, even though
he is only a laborer, he knows what they think about
it, and&#8211;&#8221; she looked squarely at her father&#8211;&#8220;I believe
him, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe that idiot?&#8221; shouted Obadiah, his face
black as night. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t have sense enough to
gouge me when your fool admissions gave him the
whip hand. He&#8217;s a fine specimen of a man for you to
be running after,&#8221; declared the mill owner with scorn.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice thing for a respectable girl to be doing.
You&#8217;ll get yourself talked about if I don&#8217;t watch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A change came over Virginia. She stiffened and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
her fear seemed to leave her. There was a glint of
anger in her eyes as they showed large against her pale
face. Her soft round chin set in an almost comical
reflection of his obstinate jaw. She arose, and her
level gaze met his angry glower, unafraid. &#8220;Stop,
father.&#8221; She spoke with wonderful self-restraint.
&#8220;You have said quite enough about Mr. Curtis. We
are talking about something else. The waste from
your mill is making people sick. What are you going
to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; cried Obadiah, in his wrathful falsetto,
his face working convulsively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been running
waste into the river for years. If people don&#8217;t like it,
let them make the most of it&#8211;go thirsty for all I
care. I&#8217;ll give them a real fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that, knowing your mill is poisoning
the water which people are forced to drink, you&#8217;ll fight
the matter in court as they were afraid you&#8217;d
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drag them through the courts until they get
so warm that any water will look good to them.&#8221;
Suddenly his temper blazed anew. &#8220;What did I tell
you this morning?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I warned you
that I would no longer tolerate your silly interference
in other people&#8217;s business. I certainly will not permit
you to butt into my affairs. You go too far&#8211;you
and the friends whom you pick up in the street. Do
you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand. You spoke too plainly this
morning for me to misunderstand your meaning&#8211;as
you are doing now. Daddy, I know that I have made
many mistakes. Yet, everything which you criticize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
was done to aid some one else and in a small way they
did spread happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had minded your own business you&#8217;d be
happier now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was trying to help other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God helps him who helps himself,&#8221; quoted Obadiah,
virtuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean to think only of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her quiet voiced argument infuriated him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
attend to your own business in the future,&#8221; he bellowed.</p>

<p>She did not flinch before his bluster but held her
ground in white faced determination. &#8220;You want me
to lead a life of selfishness when there are so many
opportunities to help others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it what you like, only get into your head the
idea that hereafter you will attend to your own affairs
and let the rest of the world do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abruptly her mood changed. She gazed at him with
a great longing. &#8220;Oh, Daddy dear, surely you are not
so selfish as all that. I know that deep in your heart
you are not.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed as if his mood were softening
to hers; but his obstinacy reasserted itself and he
hardened himself against her appeal. &#8220;I have always
managed to take care of myself and I expect the other
fellow to do the same,&#8221; he rapped. &#8220;In the future,
you and I will follow that course and avoid this sort
of trouble.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;&#8216;<span class='sc'>I must choose between your way and the way of my Mother</span>&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>For a moment the pleading look of the girl faded
into one of utter helplessness. She fought to regain
control of herself as if, having reached a decision, she
needed to arouse the physical force to carry it out.
Turning slowly, she moved over to the center table.
From its drawer she took the book which had belonged
to her mother.</p>

<p>He watched her, silenced, as he perceived the emotional
conflict which was shaking the girl strangely.</p>

<p>When she confronted him again, her face was tragic
in its sorrow. In those few seconds she had aged.
She had leaped from a girl into womanhood. Her
poise was maintained by sheer power of will. When
she spoke it was in a forced voice, as if the muscles
of her throat strained to hold back the sobs which her
tones confessed to be near. &#8220;Daddy, there are two
persons whom I should obey,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You, my
father, and&#8211;&#8221; her eyes filled with tears as she raised
the book and clasped it to her breast and whispered
ever so tenderly&#8211;&#8220;my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wonder held Obadiah speechless in its grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;A moment ago,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;you condemned
me to a life of selfishness.&#8221; She held the worn little
volume towards him, and then clutched it to her heart.
&#8220;In this book is a message from my mother. It is as
plain and clear to me as if I had heard it from her own
lips. She tells me to be unselfish and to think of
others. I must choose between your way and the way
of my mother. I do it now in your presence.&#8221; The
girl&#8217;s voice softened into an ineffable sweetness.
&#8220;Perhaps mother is here, too, and understands about
it. I choose her way, Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her manner was firmer now, except for the telltale
twitchings of the muscles of her face, as she continued.
&#8220;Knowing my mother&#8217;s wishes, I could not live as you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
would have me. I must go away.&#8221; Her voice caught.
&#8220;I must go where I can try to be unselfish. You can&#8217;t
object to my going to Aunt Kate&#8217;s&#8211;she has asked
me to visit her so often.&#8221; She swayed. Her hand
clutched at the table for support. For an instant her
face worked convulsively, and then, with a little cry
of utter misery, she ran from the room, holding the
book to her breast.</p>

<p>Late that evening Serena softly knocked at Virginia&#8217;s
door. When she was bidden to enter, the
crumpled and disheveled form upon the bed and the
tear streaked face told the story of grief to the big
hearted negress. &#8220;Ain&#8217; you gwine eat er li&#8217;l suppah,
honey chil&#8217;?&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Serena, I&#8217;m not hungry.&#8221; A great sob shook
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bettah lemme han&#8217; yo&#8217;all er cup o&#8217; tea an&#8217; suthin&#8217;
to pick on,&#8221; the old darkey pleaded. &#8220;Ah fetch it in
er minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Serena, I can&#8217;t eat. I don&#8217;t believe that I will
ever want to eat again.&#8221; A paroxysm of sobs
wrenched the little frame of the girl and she dabbed
frantically with a moist handkerchief at the great tears
which welled up in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>The springs of the bed groaned and strained as
Serena seated herself upon its edge. A gentle mothering
look was in her face, and she began to rub the
white arm gently with her big black hand. &#8220;Res&#8217;
youse&#8217;f, ma li&#8217;l honey baby,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Serena
ain&#8217; gwine let nobody hu&#8217;t her baby gal.&#8221; Suddenly
she bristled. &#8220;Dis yere hu&#8217;tin&#8217; ma honey chil&#8217;
bettah stop. Ah bus&#8217; somebody plum wide open,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
growled ferociously. &#8220;Ah fights fo&#8217; ma baby agin de
whole wo&#8217;ld.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s sobs lessened enough for her to speak.
&#8220;I am going away, Serena.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar you gwine go, chil&#8217;?&#8221; exclaimed the old
woman with much excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to Aunt Kate&#8217;s home in Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;W&#8217;en is we gwine start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I go day after tomorrow,&#8221; explained Virginia sorrowfully.
&#8220;You stay here, Serena.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howcum? Who plan dat foolishness? Wot
gwine keep me heah w&#8217;en ma honey chil&#8217; done leave?
Ah bets ah follers ma baby ef ah has to clim&#8217; ba&#8217;foot
th&#8217;ough fiah an&#8217; brimstone. Yas&#8217;r.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must stay and take care of my father, Serena.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wot ah wor&#8217;y &#8217;bout him fo&#8217;? He done mek ma
baby cry disaway. Ah follers yo&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Serena, he is my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217; ah know dat? But ain&#8217; you ma baby?&#8221;
Serena arose in great excitement and pointed a quivering
finger towards the hallway. &#8220;You&#8217; Ma done give
you to me,&#8221; she cried. But her voice softened tenderly
as she resumed, &#8220;De day you&#8217; Ma pass ovah de rivah,
ah wuz er settin&#8217; by de baid er tryin&#8217; to ease &#8217;er wid

Miss Elinor close &#8217;er eyes an&#8217; in er li&#8217;l w&#8217;ile she heah
de sweet voice er callin&#8217; &#8217;er home.&#8221; Great tears rolled
down the black cheeks of the old negress. Burying
her face in her apron, she began to sob, and a muffled
voice pleaded pathetically, &#8220;Ah caint let ma own baby
go away f&#8217;om me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the sorrow of her faithful servitor, Virginia&#8217;s
own grief was temporarily subdued. She sat up on
the bed and met the unexpected interference with her
plans with firmness. &#8220;Serena, I must go. I know
that my mother would want me to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you know?&#8221; demanded the practical Serena.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it. Something deep in my spirit
moves me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef de spi&#8217;it move you chil&#8217; you gotta go,&#8221; she
admitted, greatly persuaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Serena, even if my mother wants me to go,
she wouldn&#8217;t want me to take you away and break up
my father&#8217;s home. That would be dreadful. What
would happen to the house? Ike would get into all
sorts of mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Serena gave thoughtful heed to the catastrophe
which her departure would bring down upon the house
of Dale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to stay away from you forever,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
Serena,&#8221; Virginia continued, as she made a sorry attempt
to smile through her tear stained eyes. &#8220;You
know that I wouldn&#8217;t desert you. Promise me to take
good care of Daddy while I am gone, Serena,&#8221; pleaded
the girl. &#8220;Nothing must happen to him. He must
not be disturbed or made uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ah gwine wor&#8217;y &#8217;bout him fo&#8217;?&#8221; demanded
the old negress, obstinately.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother loved him, Serena, and so do I.
Won&#8217;t you take care of him for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>This plea weakened her stand. &#8220;Ah promises to do
de bes&#8217; ah knows how fo&#8217; a w&#8217;ile but ef yo&#8217;all stays
too long ah gwine pack ma duds an&#8217; come whar you is.
Yas&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia awakened the next morning with a bad
headache. Serena busied herself around her mistress
and finally persuaded her to take a long walk. The
brisk exercise in the fresh air refreshed the girl, and
she decided to go to the hospital and see Joe Curtis
for the last time before she left South Ridgefield.</p>

<p>In the hall of the institution she met Dr. Jackson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have seen my patients this morning,&#8221;
he told her. &#8220;Those infants are a gay lot. They
cried so loud that they gave me a headache. None
of that fretful weeping with which they serenaded me
last week. That trip up the river helped those kids
wonderfully, and, with the cool weather we are having
now, some of those youngsters are going to see
snow fly who never would have done so if it hadn&#8217;t
been for the voyage of the <i>Nancy Jane</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Knight came up and slipped an arm about Virginia&#8217;s
waist. &#8220;Tell the doctor and his babies good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
bye. He will talk a week about them if you&#8217;ll stand
and listen to him,&#8221; she laughed, and as she drew the
girl away, explained, &#8220;I have a surprise for you, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can guess it. The room for the motorcyclists is
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong. I&#8217;ll have to show you.&#8221; The
nurse led the girl through a door which opened upon
a small porch and pointed over the railing at the
grounds which, lay on the side of the building.
&#8220;There,&#8221; she said proudly. &#8220;Look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia did as she was told. In the shade of a tree
was Joe Curtis seated with outstretched leg in a roller
chair. He answered their waving hands, and his face
lighted up with a smile of pleasure which still remained
when the girl descended the stairs and came to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this fine!&#8221; she exclaimed, her delight at seeing
him out of bed dwarfing her own anxieties. &#8220;It
seems now as if you were getting better.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes danced with pleasure at her coming. Yet,
when he recognized, regardless of her efforts at concealment,
that the gloomy influence, the shadow of
which had cloaked her spirits at their last meeting, had
not departed, his face clouded. He was conscious that
his own disclosures, even though forced from him by
her, might have had some part in causing her unhappiness
and he endeavored to make amends by cheering
her. &#8220;I asked Miss Knight to send for my motorcycle
engine,&#8221; he informed her. &#8220;I told her that I
wanted to hitch it to this chair and get a little speed
out of the thing. I promised her, &#8216;Whither thou goest,
Knightie, thither will I roll.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia expressed interest in the nurse&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>&#8220;After bawling me out for calling her Knightie, she
said that I was getting so attached to her that I spent
my waking hours devising schemes to get hurt so as
not to have to leave her.&#8221;</p>

<p>His visitor&#8217;s smile of appreciation comforted Joe
greatly. He took a deep breath and flinched when his
tender ribs rebelled. His eyes roamed over the grass
and trees and he watched the fleecy clouds floating in
the azure sky. He pursued his campaign of encouragement.
&#8220;It is great to take a breath of air without
the ether flavor. It&#8217;s a wonderful old world anyhow,&#8221;
he announced, as he again viewed his surroundings
with great complacency. &#8220;Gosh!&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;I wish I may never again see the inside of a building.
Me for a job in God&#8217;s own sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the consolatory nature of Joe&#8217;s remarks,
a great loneliness had descended upon her. As she
looked at him it seemed impossible that such a change
could have come into her life since they two had
planned for the hospital room. Then she had everything
to make her happy. Now she was pledged to
leave her father, her home, the few friends of her
childhood, to go to a relative who was almost a stranger
except in name. As she pictured the future, its loneliness
frightened her. There came the temptation to
bow to her father&#8217;s will&#8211;to do anything to avoid that
cheerless future.</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, she was filled with sweet and
tender thoughts of her mother and the creed of unselfishness.
Straightway her resolution was strengthened.
She would follow the way of her mother and
be true to the message, no matter what the cost.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
Surely, God would make her father understand. Until
that time she must wait.</p>

<p>Joe&#8217;s eyes returned to the girl at his side, when, lost
in her own thoughts, she was unconscious of his
scrutiny. The unhappiness which he caught in her
face troubled him anew. &#8220;What makes you so sad,
little girl?&#8221; he demanded uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she maintained, with a smile so forced
that it pathetically denied the truth of the statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something wrong, I know,&#8221; he worried.
&#8220;Am I in any way to blame?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head violently and then told him, &#8220;I
am going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will you be gone?&#8221; He could not
watch her averted face; but something told him that
this was no ordinary trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say, Joe. Perhaps always.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he watched the soft curls at the nape of her neck,
the thought came to him that only owls and prairie
dogs find lodgment in the same hole with a rattlesnake;
whereupon the youth ceased to question and announced
as a fact of noteworthy interest, &#8220;So long as nobody
is dead, there is always a way to mend things.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of moisture in her eyes when
she turned to him and said, &#8220;Joe Curtis, you are certainly
a cheerful somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I be? I might have been killed in
the accident and I wasn&#8217;t. Now I&#8217;m nearly well.&#8221;
Into his optimism came tenderness, as he whispered,
&#8220;Best of all, I met you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it worth it?&#8221; She was moody for the moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>&#8220;You bet your life,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
glad that you met me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes answered him.</p>

<p>After a moment, he went on. &#8220;Will you tell me
where you are going, Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to Maine. To Old Rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Rock, Maine!&#8221; he shouted in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is near the home of my mother. The place is
so small that it seems strange that, with all of the
rest of the world to go to, you should be going
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia arose from the bench and came over by his
chair. &#8220;Good bye, Joe,&#8221; she said, very softly. &#8220;I
hope that you will soon be well.&#8221; A sad little face
looked down at him. &#8220;Please, forgive me for hurting
you. I am so sorry.&#8221; Her lips trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; he said roughly; but there was that in
his face which contradicted his tone. &#8220;I ran into
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t agree, can we?&#8221; she said thoughtfully,
and her voice broke as she continued, &#8220;I want to ask a
favor of you, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; He eyed her expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you see that the room&#8211;is nicely arranged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I am gone there will be no one to care&#8211;but
you.&#8221; She fought back the tears and put up a
brave front. &#8220;Good bye, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>She reached for his hand and repeated, very sweetly,
very softly, &#8220;Good bye, Joe.&#8221; She moved away a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
steps; but turned back to cry very tenderly, &#8220;Good
bye, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, please, Virginia,&#8221; wailed Joe.</p>

<p>She hesitated, battling with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, come back, Virginia. Remember, I am
helpless. I can&#8217;t come after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She retraced her steps. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked,
her averted gaze apparently interested in the street beyond
the grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps this is not good bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him now with great interest.</p>

<p>He seized her hand and drew her closer to the chair,
smiling up into her face, as he explained, &#8220;It may not
be good bye for us, because&#8211;if I were quite sure
that you wanted to see me&#8211;I might come up to Old
Rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at him. It was as if storm clouds had
broken and let the rays of the sun through. &#8220;Oh,
Joe,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it would be lovely if you came up.
Old Rock seems to be a dreadfully lonesome place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Rock lonesome!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Not a bit
of it, Virginia. There are lots of interesting things
to do. We can take grand tramps.&#8221; In his enthusiasm
for his home town, Joe forgot his game leg.
&#8220;Some evening, I&#8217;ll take you down to the big granite
bowlder, from which the town gets its name, on the
shore of the pond. We can get on top of it and watch
the moon come up over the tree covered hill on the
other side until it makes a shimmering pathway across
the water and turns the old white church on the hill
into a castle of silver. I love to sit there and watch
the lights of the village go out, one by one. It&#8217;s lovely
then. The only sounds are the song of the crickets, the
distant tinkle of a sheep bell, the splash of a leaping
bass or maybe the hooting of an old owl. It is a
beautiful place, Virginia, and with you there it would
be wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;&#8216;<span class='sc'>I think that I shall love it,&#8217; she said softly</span>&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>She listened to his words, her eyes big with interest,
and a new happiness struggling in her heart. &#8220;I think
that I shall love it,&#8221; she said softly, and, after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, &#8220;How long&#8211;how soon will you
be able to come, Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>An attendant approached to take the injured motorcyclist
back to the ward.</p>

<p>Virginia hastily withdrew her hand from Joe&#8217;s grasp
and immediately gave it back to him, when he cried,
&#8220;Not good bye but until we meet in Old Rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she watched the attendant wheel the injured man
away and turned to leave the hospital grounds, the
girl was wonderfully cheered, and her mind accepted
Joe Curtis&#8217;s picture of Old Rock by moonlight as conclusive
evidence that this ancient village was not lonesome.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>VIRGINIA MUST GO</span></h2>

<p>Virginia sank limply into the parlor car seat.
After a moment she raised herself and looked out
through the wide window upon the busy platform of
the South Ridgefield station. Serena and Ike waited
by the car nervously, endeavoring to locate the position
of their mistress by peering into the coach. The old
negress was publicly weeping.</p>

<p>As they caught sight of the girl, the train started
and with rapidly increasing speed moved down the
platform. Ike grinned a cheerful farewell while Serena
screamed her adieu, and, as if unable to bear the
separation, started to waddle along with the train, frantically
waving her black hands.</p>

<p>Virginia signaled back and shouted embarrassed little
good byes, subconsciously aware that they would
be heard by no one except her traveling companions.
As the two negroes were swept from her sight, a feeling
of utter loneliness wrapped her in its gloomy folds.
Pent up tears flooded her eyes, and so, through a mist,
she saw at the end of the platform a man and woman,
waving handkerchiefs from an automobile, who looked
remarkably like Hezekiah Wilkins and Mrs. Henderson.
Likewise, through a curtain of moisture, when
the train crossed the bridge, she perceived the stranded
<i>Nancy Jane</i>, symbolical of her own wrecked efforts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>As the roar of the train upon the bridge died away,
the girl sank back again into her seat and succumbed
completely to her grief. During those last few hours
at home she had steeled herself not to display her feelings.
She had met her father on the previous day and
explained her plans quite as calmly as if she were about
to take an ordinary vacation trip.</p>

<p>The decision of his daughter to leave him, based as
it was upon the inspiration of her mother, dead these
seventeen years, had left him strangely helpless. In
his passion he had thrust aside the cloak of idealism
in which she had arrayed him and exposed his true
character. She had struck back, unwittingly selecting
a weapon which had swept aside his momentary anger
and left him shaken and perplexed at the edge of the
abyss which had opened between them. Obadiah, too,
had been unhappy in those hours. He loved Virginia
with all the affection of which his nature was capable.
There had been moments when he would have surrendered
abjectly to his daughter on her own terms but
for the grim obstinacy which obsessed him.</p>

<p>It may be that she intuitively appreciated his mental
struggles, because, excepting only her determination to
leave home, she treated him with the tenderest consideration.
In his perplexity, Obadiah drifted for the
moment and blindly followed the girl&#8217;s lead, as if
through her alone could come the solution of the problem
which separated them. Their breakfast that morning
had been a difficult ordeal as had been their leave
taking. He had displayed no desire to accompany her
to the train and had parted from her with a grim indifference
which his troubled face belied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>Now, at least, there was relief in the luxury of a
good cry; but after a time the tears ceased and a weary
peace came. Resting her head against the back of her
chair she gave herself up to thoughts of the few little
happinesses which gleamed like bright stars in the darkness
with which she was surrounded.</p>

<p>She thought of Joe Curtis and thrilled when she remembered
the long hand clasp. His picture of Old
Rock comforted her anew as she assured herself that
such a place could not be lonely. She reviewed the
few moments in which she had bidden farewell to Mrs.
Henderson. She had dreaded Hennie&#8217;s embarrassing
questions. But, strangely, Hennie was not inquisitive.
She had broken away to rush into her kitchen crying
loudly that something was burning. This belief, from
certain remarks which had floated back, had irritated
Carrie, her cook, exceedingly. Returning, she had enveloped
the girl in a wealth of motherly tenderness, so
that in reality the visit had consisted of much sobbing
upon the older woman&#8217;s shoulder to an accompaniment
of soothing endearments and a train of explosive exclamations
from which little could be gathered.</p>

<p>Soon she began to think of her Aunt Kate and of
the new home to which she was going. Little enough
she knew. Once, shortly before the death of Elinor
Dale, Mrs. Kate Baker had visited South Ridgefield.
At the time, she had a baby daughter of Virginia&#8217;s age
and was mourning the death of her husband. For
years there had been irregular correspondence; but, as
far as Virginia was concerned, her father&#8217;s sister and
her cousin were merely names.</p>

<p>The day of tiresome travel slowly passed. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
were times when, in a wave of despair, Virginia pictured
herself adrift on a sea of sadness, where all was
dark and cheerless; but there were moments when sweet
thoughts of her mother strengthened her and made her
resolve to stand by her colors, no matter what the cost.</p>

<p>It was late that evening when the train arrived at
Old Rock. The unusual excitement and the fatigue of
traveling had brought on a persistent headache, so that
it was a most forlorn and miserable Virginia who was
helped down from the car. Hardly had her bag been
dropped at her side when the train moved on. As the
metal doors clanged shut, it seemed to the girl as if it
were the sound of the gates of her old life closing
against her. She gazed timidly about the station. It
was very dark to this girl of the city&#8211;this child of
the electric lights. The fear of the unknown seized
her. Sick, frightened, every limb of her trembling,
she hesitated helplessly.</p>

<p>A figure approached through the gloom, and the soft,
cheery voice of a girl inquired, &#8220;Cousin Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s throat was dry and husky. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Her
answer was only a whisper. A frightened little sound,
but it was all that she could make.</p>

<p>Now a hand seized her arm and she was led along the
platform. They came under a station lamp, and again
the voice spoke as they faced a tall, angular, plainly
dressed woman. &#8220;Here she is, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia looked up into a face which made her gasp
in astonishment. In the eyes, the mouth, the deep cut
lines, was resemblance to her father but, oh, with what
a difference. It was Obadiah sweetened by love and
affection. The harshness, the obstinacy, the selfishness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
of him were memories here. In their place lay a gentle,
motherly look beneath the soft, white hair and from
the eyes beamed a tender welcome to the lonely girl.</p>

<p>As Virginia hesitated diffidently, the lamp overhead
brought out the pallor and the pathos of her wan
tired little face. With never a word but just a soft
exclamation she sank into the outstretched arms of her
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor tired darling,&#8221; whispered Aunt Kate.
She fixed a look of great severity over Virginia&#8217;s shoulder
at her own daughter. &#8220;Helen,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;do
you expect visitors to carry their own baggage? Take
Virginia&#8217;s bag to the surrey.&#8221; As Helen obediently
departed, Aunt Kate gave her guest a motherly hug,
meanwhile making strange noises in her throat. Releasing
one arm with great care lest the girl be disturbed,
she endeavored to wipe a tear from her wrinkled
cheek with a finger. &#8220;Come, child,&#8221; she said
sharply. &#8220;You must get to bed. How do you feel?&#8221;
When she learned of the headache she commiserated
with her niece. &#8220;You poor child. Sleep is the best
treatment for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>A surrey drawn by a remarkably fat horse was waiting
for them back of the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you feel well, Cousin Virginia?&#8221; inquired
Helen from the front seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a headache, Cousin Helen.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was sincere relief in Helen&#8217;s voice as she replied,
&#8220;I am so glad that it is nothing worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia and her Aunt climbed into the back seat of
the conveyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; cried Helen in a loud whisper. &#8220;Archimedes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
is asleep. It&#8217;s a shame to disturb him. I
haven&#8217;t the heart to hit him,&#8221; she giggled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful and don&#8217;t strike that horse cruelly,
Helen,&#8221; Aunt Kate warned her daughter, as if that
maiden were habitually guilty of cruelty to animals.</p>

<p>Helen disregarded her mother&#8217;s remark. &#8220;Archimedes
is dreaming of corn and oats and hay and green
pastures. He must dream of such things, as he never
thinks of anything else,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop your nonsense, Helen. I have a sick girl
here who should be in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m better already,&#8221; protested Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, Arch,&#8221; cried Helen.</p>

<p>Archimedes stood fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arch,&#8221; she called again.</p>

<p>No movement followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull on the reins, Helen,&#8221; suggested Aunt Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, how many times must I tell you that to
pull on the reins is no way to start a horse. A logical
minded animal would expect you to push on the lines
when you want him to stop, and that wouldn&#8217;t do at
all.&#8221; That mischievous giggle came again and Helen
gave the horse a smart tap with the whip.</p>

<p>The lazy steed flinched slightly and moved slowly
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cruel, Helen, and keep in the gutter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, there are no automobiles out at this time
of night. For once, when we have company, we should
drive in the middle of the road. As we pay taxes, we
have a right there,&#8221; argued Helen. &#8220;I am getting
curvature of the spine from driving with one wheel in
the gutter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>&#8220;It is so much safer, Helen. Archimedes can&#8217;t get
out of the way quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he? Let the automobiles make room
for us once. Are we frightened chickens to flee from
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes the people in the machines so cross, Helen.
They say such unkind things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delightful remembrances returned to Helen.
&#8220;Mother, are you thinking of the man who offered to
lend us his jack to move Archimedes out of the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That man was very angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was, mother. I hope that he has gotten over it
by now,&#8221; laughed Helen. She clucked energetically
and went on, &#8220;As you are with us tonight, we will
pursue our usual humble way in the gutter. But,&#8221; she
declared emphatically, &#8220;when Virginia and I go driving
we will take the middle of the road and keep it in
spite of all the horn-blowing goggle-eyed men in the
state of Maine. Archimedes shall not be insulted.
His proud spirit rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jogged along, the proud spirit of Archimedes
being well content with a modest speed. Turning into
a driveway, they ascended a slight incline and drove
into a large barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my department,&#8221; Helen told her cousin
with pride as she unharnessed Archimedes. When he
was safe in his stall she paused before the white face
of a Holstein cow. &#8220;Cowslip,&#8221; she giggled, &#8220;this is
your cousin Virginia who has come to visit you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A door opened and Aunt Kate called, &#8220;Helen, bring
your cousin in. Don&#8217;t keep her out in that barn when
she has a headache.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>So, with an arm about her cousin&#8217;s waist, Helen
guided her on her first trip along a Maine domestic
pathway which begins in the stable, or even chicken
house, and runs under one roof to the parlor.</p>

<p>Virginia paused in a doorway that opened into a
large oblong room. In its center was a great, square,
brick chimney which divided it into a cosy kitchen
forming a most convenient part of the dining room,
and a dining room which was a most pleasant part of
the kitchen. The low room with its old-fashioned
paper, its white-curtained, square-paned windows and
its painted floor, was delightfully homey and cheerful.
It seemed particularly so to Virginia, with the motherly
face of her aunt smiling a kindly welcome and the
arm of her pretty blonde cousin drawing her affectionately
towards its comfort.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, with a bag in one hand and a
candlestick in the other, Helen led her cousin up the
stairs to the cosiest little bed room imaginable. Its
low ceiling sloped with the roof except where broken
by dainty curtained dormer windows. A mahogany
four poster, a highboy and a table with some chairs
constituted its furniture, while upon the floor were
round rugs of woven rags.</p>

<p>After Helen had departed and she had removed the
traces of her journey, Virginia seated herself in a
rocker for a moment. She felt as if a weight had been
lifted from her shoulders. The fear of the unknown,
which had so terrified her, was gone. In spite of her
sadness, when she thought of her father, she felt reassured
and comforted. As the girl sat there, a tender
dreamy look of indescribable sweetness crept into her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
face. Her lips moved and she whispered ever so
softly, &#8220;Mother, your way is not so hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The simple little supper, to which the three women
sat down that evening was delightful to Virginia.
And afterwards, what a gay time they had with the
dishes. The city cousin, whose headache was now a
thing of the past, donned an apron and assisted in drying
them. Never had Serena permitted her this proud
privilege and how pleased she was to do it now. She
polished the few plates upon which she had the time to
apply her intensive treatment until they shone and
sparkled bravely beneath the lamplight.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate watched her strenuous efforts for a time
in silence and then burst forth, &#8220;Good land, if I
weren&#8217;t sure that the blue on that old willow ware was
burned deep, child, I&#8217;d be afraid you&#8217;d rub it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia is exercising, mother,&#8221; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she exercises that hard on each dish, she won&#8217;t
have either the strength or time to do the rest of her
work. No man would want to marry a girl who puts
in her time wiping dishes. Most of them would rather
look at good things to eat in their plates than at the
reflection of their own faces, I&#8217;ll warrant you.&#8221;</p>

<p>How the two girls did enjoy Aunt Kate&#8217;s sage remark
and what a pleasant little chat they had when
supper was over.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate sat in her easy chair and sewed, and now
and then interjected a word of wisdom into their conversation
which convulsed them. Finally she yawned,
and, looking at the old wooden cased clock upon the
mantel, announced, &#8220;It&#8217;s time all honest folks were in
bed and rogues were movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>A short time after this pointed remark, Virginia,
tingling with the chill of the northern night which
swept in as she opened her windows, climbed into bed,
and, pulling the blankets about her, she gave a little
sigh and, very much like her old self, plunged into a
deep and dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>When she awakened the next morning, sunlight was
streaming into the room. Filled with curiosity over
her new surroundings, she sprang from her bed and
gazed out of the window. Across the road, which ran
in front of the house, a newly mowed meadow rolled
down to the shore of a lake or pond a short distance
away. Its surface, rippled by the morning breeze, glittered
and sparkled in the sun. Beyond the water, rising
abruptly from its edge, was a great hill, its slope
covered with a forest of pine and fur and hemlock.
The green expanse of the meadow was broken by
islands of maple and oak while several huge granite
bowlders stood forth against the sod in all of their grey
majesty. The color of the soft, rich summer sky,
dotted with floating masses of fleecy white, was reflected
in the flashing water. The trees and grass, yet
glistening with the morning dew, were a moist green,
untouched by the yellow of sun scorch or drought. It
was a restful verdancy which spoke of frequent rains,
of cool days and of cooler nights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia, are you awake?&#8221; came the voice of her
aunt from the hall.</p>

<p>She climbed hastily back into bed as her aunt entered.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate smiled sweetly down at the girl whose
serious eyes reflecting the color of the morning sky,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
gazed at her from a mass of wavy black hair. &#8220;How
is the headache?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It left last night, Aunt Kate, and hasn&#8217;t come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; Aunt Kate&#8217;s voice was very gentle
and sympathetic. She sat upon the edge of the bed
and, leaning forward, patted the soft cheek of her
niece.</p>

<p>Again, in the lined face of her aunt, Virginia recognized
that resemblance to her father, so wonderfully
softened by kindness and sweetness. The thought
came to the girl that her mother would have had such
a tenderness of look had she lived. A flood of memories
swept down upon her and tears welled up in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Her aunt gathered her into those mothering arms
again, and almost before the girl appreciated what she
was doing she had opened her heart and told her woes
in the gloomiest way possible.</p>

<p>After she had soothed her niece, until she could give
a teary little smile, Aunt Kate arose and, moving to
the window, viewed the familiar landscape with a stern
eye, sniffing portentously. In a moment she began to
speak. &#8220;We Dales are a selfish and obstinate family.
We were always so.&#8221; There was a note of pride in her
voice. &#8220;The men are worse than the women&#8211;much
worse&#8211;more obstinate and selfish, dear,&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;I know my brother Obadiah&#8211;better than
he knows himself. I am very glad, child, that you
told me about the whole thing.&#8221; Suddenly her voice
became sharp and emphatic and she fastened a severe
look upon Virginia. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you for a minute get it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
into your head that you have run away from home.
If you had, I should take you back myself. You
should have visited your cousin Helen and me a dozen
times before, and now we will make up for your neglect
and give brother Obadiah a chance to calm himself
after the disturbances you have created.&#8221; She
paused for a moment and then went on, smiling sweetly,
&#8220;I want you to be your own sweet self here and have
a jolly time with Helen.&#8221; Her tones became gentle.
&#8220;Follow the way of your mother until the end of your
life. Sometimes it will lead through gloomy valleys
but it is the road which leads to the sunshine of the
heights. Hum,&#8221; she cried sharply, &#8220;read &#8216;Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress,&#8217; child. It says the same thing, but better.&#8221;</p>

<p>A much cheered Virginia came down to breakfast,
and, like the very healthy young person she was, in
obedience to her aunt&#8217;s command and the natural law
of youth, forgot the unhappiness of yesterday in the
joys of the present.</p>

<p>The days which followed were crowded with happy
hours. There were drives long in time but short in
mileage behind the majestic Archimedes over tree-shaded
roads. Unaccompanied by the timid Aunt
Kate, they forsook the humble gutter and seized the
crown of the road. With peals of ringing laughter,
they pursued their slow way, unmindful of irate tourists
filled with the belief that the road and the width
thereof was theirs to be covered at fifty scorching miles
an hour, and that delays from slow moving taxpayers
were an interference with their vested rights as well as
to their progress towards the uttermost parts of the
earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>There were plunges into the cold depths of the pond
followed by wild scrambles, when, with chilled muscles,
they ran through the cool air over the meadow to
the house.</p>

<p>There were long paddles in the canoe where every
curve and bend of a stream opened a new vista of
loveliness, of woods, of stream, of hill, of rolling
meadow.</p>

<p>There were tramps through forests of fir and pine
where their feet sank into the soft cushion of needles
and they climbed until they came out on the rugged
tops of hills where, resting in weariness, they drank
deep of the pure air and feasted their eyes upon the
pleasing prospect below them.</p>

<p>Tired and weary but happy beyond relief, they would
return in the evening and, catching sight of Aunt Kate
waiting upon the porch, greet her with gay shouts and,
both speaking at once, relate stirring adventures of
field and flood with cows and frogs and sheep and
dogs.</p>

<p>Jolly feasts these three women had when sore muscles
rested after the day&#8217;s effort. Never were such
vegetables grown as came from the garden back of the
barn. Where else, pray tell, could such desserts be
found as Aunt Kate made? Or what could be more
delicious than those big bowls of raspberries or blueberries
afloat in Cowslip&#8217;s rich, thick contribution to
the feast?</p>

<p>Afterwards, Virginia would write letters until too
soon a nodding head and leaden eyelids would force
her to bed. Her correspondence was large in those
days. She wrote to Mrs. Henderson and Serena and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
Joe Curtis; but more often she wrote to her father,
telling him all that she did.</p>

<p>Regularly to her, came letters from him. They were
formal, precise epistles in a style which might be described
as having commercial tendencies and obviously
prepared by Mr. Jones at the dictation of Obadiah.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed &#8220;V,&#8221; as Helen nicknamed
her cousin, developed muscle and flesh and grew amazingly,
and the coat of tan she acquired would have
been a scandalous thing in any beauty parlor in the
land.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A FRIEND IN NEED</span></h2>

<p>A weatherworn, disreputable hammock swung
lazily between two big fruit laden apple trees beside
Aunt Kate&#8217;s home. Time was when it had been a
gaudy, betasseled thing taken into the house each night.
But familiarity breeds contempt for choice possessions
as well as friends. Now the hammock hung unwatched
from June until October. No longer a cherished
chattel, it was left to face the ravages of time
and weather and man.</p>

<p>Yet, in its ripe old age, it had achieved the goal of
all good hammocks. It had found its place, not, of
course, in the sun&#8211;that not being the custom of hammocks&#8211;but
in Aunt Kate&#8217;s household. It had become
a place of conference, of discussion, aye, even of mutual
confession for Helen and her cousin Virginia.</p>

<p>It swung lazily in the light breeze of the morning.
Not slothfully, but in the relaxation of resting strength
prepared instantly to meet its burdens and responsibilities.
It was well that this was so. Upon the self-same
breeze which swung it, came sounds of laughter
and the patter of small feet. With sudden strain and
elastic resistance, carried even to the uppermost twigs
of the trees, the hammock received the two girls as
they precipitated themselves into its lap.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>&#8220;I beat,&#8221; cried Helen with the pride of victory,
changed suddenly into a wail of anguish as a dislodged
Bell-flower apple dropped upon her head. &#8220;Oh-o-o-o,&#8221;
she groaned; &#8220;those apples make me mad. This is
the second time that one of them has struck me on the
head and I am getting tired of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her own end of the hammock Virginia was coiled
in a most precarious position. She was so interested
in her letter that she failed to give her cousin the full
measure of tender sympathy to which that maiden felt
herself entitled.</p>

<p>Helen rubbed her head with vigor. &#8220;Say something
&#8216;V.&#8217; Is anything the matter with your heart?&#8221;
she exclaimed, fixing reproachful eyes upon her absorbed
companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it hurt?&#8221; Virginia, deep in her letter, politely
inquired. Her words, however, lacked that warm condolence
for which the head and heart of her cousin
yearned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it hurt?&#8221; mimicked Helen in disgust. &#8220;What
a question! It is exactly as bad as if a brick had
fallen off the chimney on my head. Yet you sit there
and ask if it hurt. What do you think my head is
made of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge,&#8221; cried Virginia as the wind twisted her letter
so that she could not read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh-a-at?&#8221; Helen was highly indignant until she
discovered that her cousin&#8217;s remark was not a personal
allusion. &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; she threatened; &#8220;see how I
treat you the next time that you get hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia finished her letter. She wiggled over towards
Helen, an operation which placed both girls in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
imminent danger of being pitched upon their faces.
&#8220;I am sorry for your poor head, dear,&#8221; she giggled,
&#8220;or should I be sorry for the apple? Let me look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen thrust aside the inquisitive fingers. &#8220;Let me
alone, you unsympathetic wretch. Wait until my turn
comes. Even if you writhe before me in great agony,
I shall laugh. Laugh coldly&#8211;ha&#8211;ha.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia disregarded future calamities. &#8220;I have a
letter from Joe Curtis. It happens to be one which
I might read to you, if you are real nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, feminine curiosity caused Helen to forget
injuries and pledged vengeance. &#8220;Please, &#8216;V.,&#8217; I
should love to hear it,&#8221; she begged, and then listened
with rapt attention as her cousin read,</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;<i>My dear little girl</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning Miss Knight brought your letter to
me on the grounds where I had been taken in the roller
chair. She was grumbling about it being the business
of the Post Office Department to establish a rural free
delivery route and not expect her to chase around with
my mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I spend most of my time in the chair, now. Soon
I&#8217;ll be on crutches, and after that it won&#8217;t be long
before I am discharged.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this letter is written to give you the big news.
The room for motorcyclists is open for business. Miss
Knight took me to see it and it is dandy. I asked her
what she thought about it now, seeing that she had so
much to say when we were planning it. Her answer
was, &#8216;It&#8217;s the best cure for blues I know. If I am
downhearted, all I have to do is to come up here and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>think about you two innocents and I laugh myself sick.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her that her ideas of humor led towards the
psychopathic ward and warned her to beware of alienists
or squirrels because they might develop a personal
interest in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think? The very day they opened
the room it had a patient. You never would guess who
it was. It was that fellow Jones who works in your
father&#8217;s office. He must be a regular dare devil of a
rider. When the accident happened, he had cut in
front of a moving street car. The machine hung in
the fender and Jones went on and landed in a city
trash wagon at the curb. His head and face were cut
but the trash was soft. He bled so that the by-standers
decided that he was dying and sent him to the hospital.
Of course, the doctors kept him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Knight said that, from the odor about Jones
when he came in, she guessed people were careless about
separating trash from garbage. She told Jones that
he must have thought he was among old home folks
when he landed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be neighborly, I called upon him. Everything
was beautiful in the room but him. I told him that he
looked as out of place as a dead rat in a flour barrel.
That peeved him, so I asked him if he hadn&#8217;t felt more
at home in the trash wagon. He got sore and grabbed
up a glass. &#8216;I&#8217;ll bounce this off your ventilator if you
don&#8217;t get out of here,&#8217; he yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That made me mad. &#8216;You can't put me out,&#8217; I
told him. &#8216;I&#8217;ve got more right in here than you. If
you don&#8217;t stop yapping around my heels I will pull you
out of that bed and get in it myself.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>&#8220;He got crazy then and started to climb out of the
bed but Miss Knight came in and shoved him down
on his pillow. &#8216;Take that big cheese out of here before
I break his other leg,&#8217; he bawled.</p>

<p>&#8220;She began to laugh fit to kill herself and said,
&#8216;Joe, what kind of gentle sympathy do you give the
weak and injured which makes them wish to rise up
and fight?&#8217;&#8211;when she rolled me away from that wild
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your letter made me homesick for the north country.
I have fished all over that pond. You wouldn&#8217;t
catch hornpouts if you fished in the right place and
used the proper kind of bait. I used to go to the north
end of the pond by the lily pads. Bait your hook with
a live minnow and drop it in there about sundown.
The fun will come suddenly. Mr. Pickerel strikes with
the speed of an express train. Try it. When I come
up we will go fishing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A tray is coming my way so I must stop. I think
of you every day and, believe me, just as soon as this
hospital turns me loose I am going to go where I can
see and talk to the nicest girl in all the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good bye, Miss Hornpout catcher.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p class='btar'>&#8220;Affectionately,<br />&#8220;<span class='sc'>Joe</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s face was aglow with happiness as she finished
reading and turned to Helen. &#8220;He is the nicest
man. Doesn&#8217;t he write interesting letters to me?&#8221; she
murmured softly.</p>

<p>The sentimental Helen gazed into the distance, lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
in dreams conjured by this epistle. &#8220;Yes, he does,&#8221;
she agreed. &#8220;You must adore him, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s face crimsoned at this bold remark.
&#8220;We are only friends,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sincere friendship and complete understanding between
two is wonderful,&#8221; sighed Helen from her eighteen
years&#8217; experience of the vicissitudes of life, and she
displayed further keen insight into the problems of existence,
when she continued, &#8220;Sympathetic appreciation
strengthens one to meet sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia gazed raptly at her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such sincere friendship should be cherished as
some tender flower,&#8221; Helen went on. &#8220;Is it not
written that from the mouths of babes shall come
wisdom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do express yourself so well, Helen. You
have so much feeling in your nature&#8211;such breadth to
your character, dear,&#8221; responded Virginia.</p>

<p>The two girls pensively viewed the pond, possibly
recuperating from the strain of their conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It almost seems that I know him,&#8221; Helen whispered.</p>

<p>Virginia turned suspiciously upon her cousin. &#8220;Did
you know Joe Curtis? Did you go to school with
him?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember the name, &#8216;V.&#8217; What does he
look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Very valiantly Virginia attempted a word picture of
Joe. &#8220;He is a big fellow. His eyes are black&#8211;and
large&#8211;and dreamy.&#8221; She mused for a moment
and resumed with animation. &#8220;His eyes are bright&#8211;and
snapping&#8211;and brave&#8211;&#8221; again she paused and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
then she concluded very softly&#8211;&#8220;and sweet. He has
a smile which tears your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful he must be!&#8221; sighed Helen. She
shook her head emphatically. &#8220;If I had met him, I
should have remembered him until the last hour of my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed a dreamy silence devoted to maidenly
meditation concerning the manifold charms of Joe
Curtis until an idea caused Helen to cry, &#8220;Virginia,
you should go fishing in the place Joe wrote about. I
know where it is. Think of it, you would fish in the
same place, in the same water and by the same lily pads
where he has been. We couldn&#8217;t catch the same fish
but we might catch relatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go now,&#8221; agreed Virginia, moved greatly by
Helen&#8217;s sentimental suggestion.</p>

<p>It was a long pull in the row boat to the head of the
pond; but they took turns at the oars and at last arrived
at their destination. The day was warm and the
exercise at the oars did not cool the girls.</p>

<p>Helen noted the position of the sun which yet hung
high. &#8220;Nothing will bite, now &#8216;V.,&#8217;&#8221; she objected.
&#8220;We came hours too soon. He said to fish at sundown.
We had better go ashore and wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glad to get out of the burning sun, they rowed to the
shore and, clambering up the bank, dropped down in a
shady spot.</p>

<p>Suddenly Helen became restless. &#8220;I hear a strange
humming noise,&#8221; she worried.</p>

<p>Virginia was likewise nervously alert. &#8220;I hear it,
too. It&#8217;s a low buzzing&#8211;much louder than mosquitoes,&#8221;
she agreed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>&#8220;What can it be?&#8221; Helen troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my hornets&#8217; nest,&#8221; cried a childish voice behind
them.</p>

<p>With startled exclamations, the girls turned their
heads.</p>

<p>Looking over the top of a granite bowlder a short
distance away was a small boy. He was a very thin
and delicate child about five years old, wearing a pair
of faded khaki rompers and a shirt of the same material.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know any better than to sit under a hornets&#8217;
nest?&#8221; he exclaimed in disgust. &#8220;Do you want
to get yourselves stung to death?&#8221;</p>

<p>The two girls raised their eyes. Partially concealed
by the lower branches of the tree, a great cone of clay
hung above them. From it and the insects flying about
it came the buzzing sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crawl, Virginia, and don&#8217;t you dare make a noise,&#8221;
whispered Helen.</p>

<p>From the top of the rock the infant witnessed the
ignominious retreat from dangerous territory.
&#8220;Come over here,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Much hornets never
come near me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Relying upon the superior judgment of the masculine
mind, the girls turned and humbly crept towards this
place of refuge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you might stand up, now,&#8221; the boy told
them. &#8220;If the hornets had wanted to sting you, they&#8217;d
have done it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>They arose and forthwith began to dust their skirts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; commanded the child in a voice of alarm.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got any sense? Want to get me stung?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
If you make a noise the hornets will come sneaking
over to see what is going on.&#8221; His manner changed
to one of great politeness as he went on, &#8220;I have a
house back here. You can come over there and dust
yourselves if you want to.&#8221; He slid down back of the
rock. When he reappeared around its corner, he made
funny little skips and for the first time they noticed
that he used a crutch. One of his legs was flexed by
distorted muscles until he carried it a couple of inches
above the ground. Notwithstanding this handicap, he
moved rapidly along a pathway ahead of him. Where
the grass of the meadow began at the edge of the
woods, he waited for them and pointed with pride to
a small opening in a clump of birches. &#8220;This is my
house,&#8221; he told them.</p>

<p>Virginia dropped upon her knees and peeped in.
&#8220;How lovely,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Before her the flat top of a rock projecting slightly
above the surface of the ground served as a floor.
A thick hedge of birch saplings grew about it, constituting
the walls. The branches arching it had been
cut away as high as a man&#8217;s head. Above this they
joined in a dense mass, forming the roof of the bower.</p>

<p>Following their little host, the girls entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a lovely house,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;Did you
make it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God made most of it,&#8221; he answered with great
solemnity. &#8220;Mother cut away the high branches and
I cut the low ones and it was done. I didn&#8217;t have it
all, at first, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; Helen inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Woodchuck lived in the cellar beneath the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
stone. There is his stairway.&#8221; He pointed to an
opening at the edge of the rock, surrounded by pebbles
and clay. &#8220;As soon as I moved in Mr. Woodchuck
moved out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all alone now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no indeed, a chipmunk lives over there, who
is very friendly. Up in that tree is a bird&#8217;s nest; but
the young ones have gone away now. Then there are
the hornets and a snake lives under the rock over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snakes!&#8221; screamed both of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a grass snake.&#8221; The infant was openly disgusted
at the display of feminine timidity. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
afraid of an old snake? I&#8217;m not. That snake is so
afraid that I will catch him that he don&#8217;t dare come
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The neighborhood distrust relieved the fears of the
visitors and they began to make themselves comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8216;V.,&#8217; this would be a grand place to eat our
lunch,&#8221; suggested Helen and to the boy she said, &#8220;We
have something to eat in our boat. May we bring it
here and will you have lunch with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be fine,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;You get your
lunch and I will get some milk for us to drink from
my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t disturb her,&#8221; protested Virginia. &#8220;We
have plenty. And we have a thermos bottle of water,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother won&#8217;t care a bit. She loves to have
me eat and she wants me to drink lots of milk so that
I will grow big and strong to take care of her. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
haven&#8217;t any father, you see.&#8221; Without further words
the lad disappeared.</p>

<p>Taking care to avoid the hornets, the girls brought
their lunch from the boat and were soon joined by the
boy bringing a pitcher of milk and some tin cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother said that she was glad for us to have the
milk and that after lunch I am to bring you up to see
her. Please come,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;I want my mother
to know both of you so that after you are gone I can
talk to her about you and she will understand. I don&#8217;t
often have visitors at my house.&#8221; In a burst of confidence,
&#8220;I never had any before. Please do come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pleading face of the boy was very attractive to
Virginia as she looked into it. Its wistfulness persuaded
her. &#8220;We will go and see your mother,&#8221; she
promised.</p>

<p>A happy, satisfied smile came into his face. There
was something familiar about that to Virginia. Her
eyes became dreamy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kiss you,&#8221; Helen suddenly announced.</p>

<p>He resisted violently but was overpowered and force
prevailed. &#8220;What do you want to do that for?&#8221; he
objected, unappreciative of the favor so generously
showered upon him by the fair Helen. &#8220;It spoils the
fun. Don&#8217;t you know any better than to want to kiss
a feller all the time?&#8221; he complained.</p>

<p>The sight of food pacified the infant as the girls
spread the lunch. They all enjoyed the feast in the
leafy bower and consumed a remarkable quantity of
sandwiches, doughnuts, apple pie and milk. &#8220;My,
but that was good!&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
that my house is a good place to eat in? I told my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
mother that if I could eat here all of the time I would
get fat; but she said that I would become a worse little
savage than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy chattered on as he led them over the meadow
towards the back of a weather-beaten farmhouse.
&#8220;Moth-er, Moth-er,&#8221; he shouted, as they approached
the back door.</p>

<p>A middle aged woman of good appearance came to
the door. Trouble had deeply marked her face.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in?&#8221; she urged. &#8220;Charles Augustus,&#8221;
she reproved her son, &#8220;you should bring ladies
to the front of the house, not to the kitchen door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; he argued. &#8220;You can
get in either way, mother, and this is the nearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls, much amused at the reasoning of Charles
Augustus, followed his mother through a spotless
kitchen and dining room into a very plainly furnished
front room.</p>

<p>For a time Charles Augustus sat most sedately in a
chair, listening to the conversation of the girls with
his mother; but as the minutes passed; he became restless.</p>

<p>Recognizing this, his mother suggested that he get
some sweet apples from a tree in front of the house
for their guests.</p>

<p>Passing out of the open front door, he paused upon
the stoop and began a shrill little tuneless whistle. As
he moved forward, his foot or his crutch slipped. He
lurched forward as if about to plunge headlong down
the flight of steps which led to the yard below.</p>

<p>The eyes of the women had followed the little fellow,
and as he swung forward they were filled with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
alarm. With half suppressed screams they sprang to
their feet, thrusting out their arms as if they might
catch him.</p>

<p>By a marvelous effort, the boy recovered his balance.
He resumed his whistling as if nothing had
happened and clumped heavily down the steps, disappearing
from their view.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief the girls sank back into their
chairs.</p>

<p>But the mother remained standing, her eyes yet
upon the doorway through which her son had departed.
Her raised hands dropped to her side and
the look of horror passed from her face, leaving it old
and tired looking.</p>

<p>Helen arose and, with a word of explanation, disappeared
after Charles Augustus.</p>

<p>Virginia marked the hands of the woman yet trembling
from her shock. She reached forward and, gently
pulling her down into a chair, pressed her soft
cheek against the wrinkled face.</p>

<p>The woman fought to control her emotion, but her
face sank into her hands and she began to weep.
After a time her sobs lessened and she became calmer.
She tried to smile through her tears at the girl. &#8220;He
is my baby,&#8221; she whispered; &#8220;my lame, helpless boy.&#8221;
A change came over her. She threw back her head and
resistance blazed in her eyes. &#8220;He shan&#8217;t be lame,&#8221;
she cried, shaken by the intensity of her feelings.
Quickly the mood merged into one of utter helplessness.
&#8220;If I could get the money,&#8221; she groaned, but
almost instantly her former temper returned. &#8220;I will
get it,&#8221; she resolved. &#8220;My boy shall have a fair start
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
in life if I have to crawl on my hands and knees to
get it for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia endeavored to soothe the almost hysterical
woman. At last the tense nerves relaxed and self-control
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must think me silly and weak,&#8221; the woman
told her. &#8220;I have been worrying too much. I am
so alone with my thoughts here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have Charles Augustus,&#8221; suggested Virginia,
as she stroked the bent shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted the woman. &#8220;But he goes to bed
at six o&#8217;clock and that leaves the long evening in which
to sit and think&#8211;and hate,&#8221; she blazed. Yet, in an
instant her anger had departed and she went on sadly,
&#8220;It is very lonely after Charles Augustus is asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he your only child?&#8221; the girl asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have another boy, much older. He is big
and strong and handsome and can take care of himself
and his mother,&#8221; she explained with pride. &#8220;But he
is young and is working his way through college. His
pay is small and he has had some bad luck, but he is
a joy and happiness in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia watched the woman as if fascinated.</p>

<p>Thought for the comfort of her callers returned
with composure to the mother of Charles Augustus.
&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said kindly, &#8220;I suppose that you are
in Maine for a vacation. You don&#8217;t look like a native.
It&#8217;s a shame for me to spoil this beautiful afternoon
for you with my tears and troubles. I am
nervous and overwrought. I had wonderful news yesterday.
News which may make me glad all of the
rest of my days or make me always sad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>&#8220;Please tell me about it,&#8221; begged Virginia.</p>

<p>The woman yielded to the girl&#8217;s entreaties and explained
that, on the previous day, Charles Augustus
had been taken to a physician in Old Rock because of
some infantile disease. After treating the boy, the
doctor had examined his leg with great interest.
Hunting up a copy of a recent medical journal he had
shown the mother a description of an operation for a
similar case in a New York hospital. It had resulted
in the complete recovery of the use of a crippled limb.
&#8220;That boy&#8217;s leg could be cured if we could get him on
an operating table before he is too old,&#8221; the doctor had
declared with confidence.</p>

<p>The news of the possibility of her son&#8217;s cure had
filled Charles Augustus&#8217;s mother with joy; but her inability
to raise the money for such an operation had
almost driven her frantic.</p>

<p>When she ended, Virginia took hold of her hands.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me help you?&#8221; she begged softly.
&#8220;There must be a way to do it and I should like to,
for&#8211;&#8221; she hesitated a moment and then&#8211;&#8220;the sake
of Charles Augustus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman looked into the girl&#8217;s eyes. She found
a sweetness there which appealed to her. &#8220;I would
have no right to refuse any help which would rid my
boy of that crutch,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>At the door Virginia glanced back. &#8220;Charles Augustus&#8217;s
crutch would make nice kindling wood,&#8221;
she called. &#8220;A motorcycle would be much nicer for
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hopeful smile crept over the tired face of the
woman. &#8220;Life would be very beautiful if my Charles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
Augustus could run and play and ride a wheel like
other boys,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Virginia found her cousin and the lad in the midst
of a great romp. He beamed at Helen, of whom he
had become a great admirer, regardless of her sentimental
tendencies. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t miss your cousin one
bit, did we?&#8221; he announced, and then, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
anything in that to laugh at,&#8221; when the girls gave vent
to their merriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going now, Charles Augustus,&#8221; Helen told
him. &#8220;Kiss me good bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of his earlier attitude, the lad succumbed
to the allure of a beautiful woman as has man since
the beginning of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming again soon?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Virginia answered. She was very serious
and thoughtful as she followed the lad and the gay
and talkative Helen another way to the pond. As she
passed the mail box, she raised her eyes and upon it
read the name, &#8220;Curtis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Joe has his mother&#8217;s
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AUNT KATE LENDS A HAND</span></h2>

<p>The next morning Virginia wrote Mrs. Henderson
about the case of Charles Augustus. She wrote also
to Joe Curtis, but in her letter she did not refer to her
meeting with his mother and lame brother or to her
visit to his home. Afterwards she went out and sat
in the hammock. Swinging gently, she gazed with
serious eyes at the landscape; but her thoughts gave
but little heed to the beautiful scenery which lay before
her.</p>

<p>With motherly interest, Aunt Kate watched her
niece through the kitchen window. Wise in the habits
and customs of young women, she noted unfavorable
portents. &#8220;Lands sakes,&#8221; she called to Helen, &#8220;Virginia
is moping away in the hammock trying to make
herself homesick. Hurry out and cheer the poor child
up. Don&#8217;t let her get lonesome and unhappy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen obediently entered upon her kindly mission.
Seating herself by her cousin, she put an arm about
her and gave her cheery greeting, &#8220;Hello cuticomes.
Of whom are you dreaming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking of Charles Augustus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a darling kid. I could eat him for candy.&#8221;
The cannibalistic Helen smiled anything but fiercely at
the thought of her tender prey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>&#8220;He is so sweet, Helen. That makes it sadder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Makes what sad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His lameness. It is dreadful. Think of it, Helen,
never to be able to run and play in comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shadows of unhappiness clouded the usual cheerfulness
of Helen&#8217;s face. &#8220;It is terrible,&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;All through his life,&#8221; the melancholy Virginia
went on, &#8220;that crutch must be with him. Even when
he proposes to a girl it will be beside him at her feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could leave it in the hall with his hat.&#8221; Helen&#8217;s
optimism attempted to thrust aside the enshrouding
gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Virginia was determined that no ray of
light should brighten the dark picture she was painting.
&#8220;When Charles Augustus proposes, unless the
crutch is near, he can&#8217;t get from his knees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen conceded the point by a helpless nod. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t be a bit romantic. It will be pathetic,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if the girl loves him truly. Not if he is the
answer to the call of her heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be the Knight of her thoughts then,&#8211;the
Prince of her dreams,&#8221; interjected Helen, the
sentimental.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a crutch. He will rest on it even at his
wedding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When they go away on their wedding trip, the
rice and old shoes will beat against it,&#8221; groaned Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be at his bedside when he dies.&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s
eyes filled with tears. &#8220;Were he a soldier it would be
a badge of honor&#8211;a mark of patriotic suffering; but
poor Charles Augustus was always that way and must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
always remain so unless some one will pay for an operation.&#8221;
Virginia buried her tear-drowned eyes in
her handkerchief.</p>

<p>The sympathetic Helen succumbed to the prevailing
sorrow of the occasion and wept also.</p>

<p>From her watch tower at the kitchen window, Aunt
Kate espied the sorrowing ones. &#8220;My sakes alive,
what has got into those girls?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;They
must be hankering for a funeral.&#8221; Hastening forth,
she planted herself before them and viewed the weepers
with stern eyes. &#8220;What is all of this crying
about?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>They told her, abating no jot or tittle of gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Charles Augustus unhappy yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; they admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; Aunt Kate&#8217;s voice rang forcefully,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the use of crying over happiness? Tears are
to wash sorrows away.&#8221; Her final remark pointed her
thoughts in a practical direction. &#8220;You two can wash
the surrey as well as for me to pay Tom fifty cents
to do it. You can use some of those tears around
here if you get tired of pumping water.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the grief stricken arrayed themselves in bathing
suits and tugged the surrey into the sun. They
hitched the hose to the force pump and labored diligently
amidst floods of conversation and torrents of
water. They polished and, inadvertently or with
malice aforethought, turned water upon one another
until peals of laughter echoed into the kitchen. A
complacent Aunt Kate gave but little heed to them
until they presented themselves before her, much bedrabbled
but in an exceedingly cheerful frame of mind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>She gazed over her glasses at them and said, &#8220;Mercy
sakes, I told you girls to wash the surrey not yourselves.
Get off those wet clothes before you catch
your death of cold.&#8221; As they disappeared towards
the stairs she called after them, &#8220;You girls were bound
to have a moist morning. Now I hope that you are
satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Days passed which Aunt Kate, in her wisdom, saw
were busy ones. At last an answer came to Virginia&#8217;s
letter to Mrs. Henderson. Hennie had a habit of accomplishing
the things which she undertook and her
response was most satisfactory. She had arranged
for the operation upon Charles Augustus at the New
York hospital. A place had been found for Mrs.
Curtis to stay and tickets had been placed at the Old
Rock station for her and her son.</p>

<p>Sufficient funds had been raised to cover everything
but the operating fee. But as soon as the case came
to the attention of the surgeon, he had suggested that,
as the matter of age was a very important factor in
the ultimate success of his efforts, the operation be
performed at once. He was quite willing to await
the result of Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s further exertions for
the payment of his bill.</p>

<p>A very happy and delighted Virginia cried the good
news aloud to Aunt Kate and Helen. &#8220;Right after
lunch we will go and see Mrs. Curtis and Charles
Augustus and tell them the good news,&#8221; she planned.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Hennie perfectly splendid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Kate was making pies. Her eyes twinkled
as she told Virginia, &#8220;I don&#8217;t gather from this letter
that your friend Mrs. Henderson spent much time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
weeping over Charles Augustus&#8217;s crutch. She is going
to get rid of the old thing. That line or two you
wrote did the lame boy much more good than all the
tears you and Helen wasted around here the other
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia bobbed her head in agreement with the
wisdom of her aunt. Then she climbed the stairs to
make ready for her trip, lifting a sweet little voice in
song.</p>

<p>As Aunt Kate heard her, she smiled gently; but her
face grew suddenly stern as she muttered, &#8220;Until I
settle brother Obadiah&#8217;s hash, I&#8217;d better keep an umbrella
and a mackintosh handy if I don&#8217;t want to get
wet&#8221;; after which she dusted the flour from her hands
with great vigor.</p>

<p>The two girls gave little time to their lunch that
noon, and soon afterwards started up the pond in a
canoe. Helen was filled with energy. She dug her
paddle into the water and pulled mightily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, Helen, we are turning around,&#8221; protested
Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paddle your share, &#8216;V.&#8217;,&#8221; retorted Helen with an
air of injury. &#8220;Remember, you are not a passenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>By vigorously wielding her paddle, Virginia managed
to hold the canoe on its course. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t
make me work so hard, Helen,&#8221; she objected. &#8220;We
want to hurry and get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are doing that splendidly, &#8216;V.&#8217; We can&#8217;t go
very fast if you want to sit and dream. Paddle, dear
heart&#8211;work your way.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/illus4.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;&#8216;<span class='sc'>You are my sweetheart,&#8217; the brazen Helen told him</span>&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>So it came to pass that Virginia paddled to keep
up with Helen and that young woman paddled to make
her cousin work, and thus the light canoe was driven
over the water with speed and they soon reached the
end of their voyage.</p>

<p>Charles Augustus espied their approach afar off
and hobbled down the meadow path to meet them with
joyous outcry. &#8220;Hello, you came to see me, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. You are my sweetheart,&#8221; the brazen
Helen told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; he sighed, shaking his head after the manner
of an elderly philosopher. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time
since I saw you. I expected you every day. Mother
said that she guessed you were busy people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis came to the door at the sound of voices.
Her face lighted when she recognized them. &#8220;Charles
has been watching for you each day,&#8221; she told them.
&#8220;I tried to persuade him that you might have interests
besides visiting small boys; but I wasn&#8217;t very
successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Augustus balked in the pathway, pulling at
the hand of Helen. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s go in. It&#8217;s much
nicer out here. Let&#8217;s play as we did the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis nodded understandingly when Helen
bowed to her admirer&#8217;s wishes, and led Virginia into
the house. &#8220;It is nice of you to come and see me
again so soon,&#8221; she told the girl when they were
seated in the front room; &#8220;especially after the way
I must have tired you with my troubles and drowned
you with my tears.&#8221; Her forced gaiety could not deceive
one to whom she had opened her heart. The
marks of trouble and anxiety showed too plainly in
her face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>Virginia saw the opportunity to transmit the good
tidings she had brought. Its very bigness embarrassed
her. &#8220;I have some good news for you,&#8221; she
cried, and abruptly thrust the letter towards the older
woman, her eyes big and tender with the joy of her
message. &#8220;There!&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;Read&#8211;read
that, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis took the letter from Mrs. Henderson
and began to peruse it.</p>

<p>It seemed to Virginia that she would never finish.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Curtis turned towards the girl. Her
face was pale and the stress of her emotion weakened
her. &#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you,&#8221; she whispered in a queer
strained voice. Suddenly her strength swept back to
her. Under the force of the joy which enveloped her
she spoke in a dead monotone, staring ahead of her
with unseeing eyes. &#8220;My Charles will walk and play
like other boys. In a few weeks&#8211;perhaps before
Thanksgiving Day&#8211;he can throw aside his crutch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia, agitated by the intenseness of the other&#8217;s
feelings, watched in silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis had forgotten her visitor now. She
was thinking aloud. &#8220;What a happy day it will be
for Joe and Charles and me,&#8221; she murmured,&#8211;&#8220;the
happiest since my husband died.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gladness of the other thrilled the girl.</p>

<p>Like a flash there came a change in Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s
mood. Her joy came into conflict with a defiant
pride. Her face became cold and hard. &#8220;It&#8217;s charity,&#8221;
she wailed, &#8220;just plain charity. Am I a beggar
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned furiously upon Virginia, transformed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
by passion, &#8220;If my husband had lived&#8211;if I, a weak
woman, had been given a fair chance to make an
honest living in this land of the free,&#8221; she sneered, &#8220;I
too would ride in my automobile in silks and diamonds
and extend charity to the poor. If there were justice
among men I would not be in a position where people
could offer me charity.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bewildered Virginia listened timidly as the woman,
almost beside herself, went on, &#8220;There is no justice&#8211;there
is no right,&#8221; Her eyes seemed ablaze to the
startled girl. She thrust her arms above her head.
&#8220;The wicked prosper and the good are ruined. It&#8217;s
all wrong&#8211;wickedly wrong,&#8221; she screamed and, rushing
into an adjoining room, cast herself across the
bed, sobbing convulsively.</p>

<p>Amazed at the effect of Hennie&#8217;s letter, Virginia was
tempted to run away. She hesitated, however.
Through the doorway she could see the shaking form
of Joe&#8217;s mother upon the bed. Quickly the passion
died out of the sobs of the weeping woman and in its
place came a note of pathetic helplessness which
clutched at the girl&#8217;s heart and seemed to call her.</p>

<p>In a moment Virginia was at the side of the bed.
Leaning over, she took one of the toil worn hands into
her own. There came an answering pressure and the
girl seated herself by the bed-side holding the knotted
fingers in her own. The sobs lessened, the quivering
form became calmer, and at length Mrs. Curtis sat
up and raised wet eyes to those of her visitor. &#8220;You
must think me lacking in appreciation of the generosity
of your friends,&#8221; she choked, still shaken by the
reflex of her sobs. &#8220;It&#8217;s not true, though. That was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
a display of my silly pride. It&#8217;s about all that I have
left of the happiest days of my life. Forget my words,
dear, and forgive me. From the bottom of my heart,
I thank you for what you have done for my boy and
me. To have him walk without a crutch, on my
hands and knees I&#8217;d scrub the most crowded street in
the world. There is no humiliation too great for me
to undergo for him. I would glory in it.&#8221; In the
glow of mother love her face softened and became
beautiful. Now she seemed to grasp the full significance
of the news and to be filled with unrest as if
afraid that the opportunity might escape. &#8220;When
can we go?&#8221; she worried&#8211;&#8220;tomorrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Today, if you wish,&#8221; Virginia explained.</p>

<p>Her woes cast aside and filled with excitement, Mrs.
Curtis dried her tears and returned to the other room
with the girl. Through the window Charles Augustus
could be seen hobbling about in a game with the active
Helen. His mother watched his awkward movements
intently for a moment. &#8220;In a few months he
will be running about without the crutch,&#8221; she whispered
and, swinging about, she seized Virginia by her
shoulders, looked deep into her eyes as she murmured
gently, &#8220;May God bless you and yours for what you
are doing for me and mine, and may happiness be
yours and theirs until the end of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Augustus displayed greater interest in the
journey he was about to take than in the fact that he
might no longer need his crutch. As he passed through
the meadow with the girls he explained his position.
&#8220;It&#8217;s great fun to travel on the cars. I don&#8217;t care
a bit where I go, so it&#8217;s some place else.&#8221; Possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
objections arising from the change struck him.
&#8220;When I come back, will you come and see me, even
if I don&#8217;t have a crutch?&#8221; he asked Helen.</p>

<p>The enchantress caught him in her arms and answered
him with a kiss.</p>

<p>Regardless of this attention, dissatisfaction crept
into his face. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t have my crutch, I will
catch you all of the time. There&#8217;ll be no fun in playing
with a girl who always has to be &#8216;it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His fears did not impress Helen the agile. &#8220;When
you are able to play without your crutch,&#8221; she promised
him, &#8220;I shall fly with delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like an aeroplane?&#8221; inquired Charles Augustus
with great seriousness.</p>

<p>They left him standing upon the shore. As they
paddled away he was leaning on his crutch, watching
something. Suddenly he made a hopping dart and
dropped to the ground. Instantly he was up again,
shouting triumphantly, &#8220;Look&#8211;look at the old bullfrog
I caught.&#8221; He held the slimy creature aloft, by
one of its legs, for the admiration of the girls and
asked, &#8220;Do you think that my mother will let me
take him to New York with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask her,&#8221; suggested the diplomatic Helen.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the happy outcome of her efforts
to help Charles Augustus, Virginia was very silent
and preoccupied that evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;That child is homesick,&#8221; Aunt Kate thought, as she
kissed her good night and watched her slowly ascend
the stairs, candlestick in hand.</p>

<p>As Virginia undressed, she was very thoughtful.
She went over to the dresser and, holding Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
Henderson&#8217;s letter close to the candle&#8217;s flame, re-read it.
There was a wistful, helpless look in her face when
she was ready to climb into bed. &#8220;Oh, Daddy,
Daddy,&#8221; she whispered sadly, &#8220;please believe as
mother did, so that I can come back home.&#8221; An hour
afterwards she fell asleep upon a pillow moistened
with tears.</p>

<p>The two girls were at the station in the morning to
say good bye to Charles Augustus and his mother as
they departed for New York.</p>

<p>Before the train left Charles Augustus complained
to Helen, &#8220;Mother wouldn&#8217;t let me take my frog to
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is too bad,&#8221; commiserated the deceitful
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother said that the frog wouldn&#8217;t care for New
York. He might get lonesome there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen gravely considered the problem. &#8220;Your
mother is right, Charles. A frog would find few
friends and little amusement in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia bade Mrs. Curtis good bye at the car steps.
&#8220;You will write and tell us about everything, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she begged.</p>

<p>The older woman embraced her. &#8220;Good bye,&#8221; she
murmured. &#8220;Words can&#8217;t tell what I would say to
you, dear. Of course I will write.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the days passed and the best of news came
from New York. The operation was performed and
the twisted muscles worked into place. The surgeon
was confident of the success of his efforts and felt
sure that, at the worst, Charles Augustus would only
have a slight limp which would disappear with age.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>Yet Virginia was not happy. Very sweet she was
and thoughtful of others; but she was serious and
often, too, a look of sadness rested on her face.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate watched her with the vigilant eye of a
mother in those days. One afternoon she discovered
her niece alone in the hammock, viewing the pond with
a melancholy countenance. &#8220;Land sakes, that child
is moping again,&#8221; she groaned. Leaving her work,
she joined the girl and commanded, &#8220;Tell me your
thoughts, Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment the girl was startled. &#8220;I was
thinking about South Ridgefield,&#8221; she confessed timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; Aunt Kate exclaimed, apparently much
puffed up by her mind-reading ability. &#8220;You are
trying to see how unhappy you can make yourself and
every one else who looks at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was mute before this accusation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you thinking of your father?&#8221; asked Aunt
Kate, proceeding with her examination of the witness.</p>

<p>The girl nodded sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think of him?&#8221; Aunt Kate seemed
shocked at the depraved taste of Obadiah&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Kate, I do wish that he would pay for
Charles Augustus&#8217;s operation. I would feel as if
there might be some chance of my going home some
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that you don&#8217;t care for the company of
Helen and me, Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl gave her aunt a pleading look. &#8220;You
know what I mean. I love you and Helen dearly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>The older woman softened, patting her niece upon
the cheek; but she stuck to the business at hand.
&#8220;That water business would cost your father a lot
of money, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Virginia agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum,&#8221; muttered Aunt Kate. &#8220;We&#8217;d better give
Obadiah a light dose to begin on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, Aunt Kate,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; responded the older woman. &#8220;What
I want to know is, have you asked your father to pay
for the operation on that lame boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he knows nothing about it,&#8221; admitted Virginia.
&#8220;Aunt Kate, I would be afraid to ask him
after the way he talked to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid!&#8221; Aunt Kate was filled with astonishment.
&#8220;Afraid of Obadiah? My stars and garters!
You must begin some place! How on earth do you
expect him to give to something he never heard of?
Don&#8217;t you know child, that to get a Dale to do anything
which costs money you must ask them not once,
but thrice. Seventy times seven is about right for
Obadiah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Aunt Kate, after what my father said, I
couldn&#8217;t ask him to help pay Charles Augustus&#8217;s
bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Aunt Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why. I am sure, though, that I
couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know why,&#8221; declared Aunt Kate. &#8220;It is obstinacy&#8211;plain
Dale obstinacy sticking out of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was silent for a moment, possibly reviewing
her personal characteristics as illuminated by her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
aunt. Then she asked, &#8220;You think that I should ask
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, give brother Obadiah a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Aunt Kate, he will refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will write him then that you are going to stay
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; groaned Virginia, great tears springing into
her eyes opened wide with alarm. &#8220;Then I could
never go home as long as I live. I&#8217;d never see Daddy
or Serena or even Ike again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks, child, don&#8217;t be a weakling.&#8221; Her
eyes twinkled. &#8220;This is no tragedy. It is only a
difference of opinion, with brother Obadiah, as usual,
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a tragedy if I could never go and
see my father.&#8221; Virginia shook her head sorrowfully.
&#8220;I have been thinking about it lots lately, and
sometimes I wonder if my mother would want me
to stay away from home much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Kate put her arm about the girl. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you trust to the judgment of your old aunt, who knew
your mother before you? I don&#8217;t want your efforts
to help other people to be turned into a punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of that, too.&#8221; Virginia was very
solemn as she spoke. &#8220;Perhaps I went about it the
wrong way. If I had done things differently perhaps
I wouldn&#8217;t have made Daddy angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not allow yourself to worry, dear. We
will give your father a chance to help Charles Augustus.
If he doesn&#8217;t do it, something else will come up
and we will keep on giving him the opportunity. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
the end everything will work out for the best, I am
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>So that afternoon Virginia wrote to her father and
asked him to contribute towards the expense of the
operation upon Charles Augustus. It was a cheery
letter and in no word of it could one guess the tears
and longings between the lines.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s answer, as befitted a good business man,
was prompt. While he admitted the sadness of the
case he could see no reason why he should be asked
to pay for an operation upon a boy of whom he knew
nothing. He enclosed a small check and concluded
his letter with directions that his daughter return home
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I expected,&#8221; announced Aunt Kate, when
Virginia, the bewildered subject of conflicting emotions,
brought it to her. &#8220;Obadiah is wild to have
you home. That is our strength. Don&#8217;t you surrender
to him, Virginia. I wouldn&#8217;t be a slave to any
man and certainly not to brother Obadiah. I always
made him step about, I can promise you. And if you
follow my advice you can, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s face was wistful. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make
Daddy step about, Aunt Kate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You started this revolution, Virginia, and you
must see it through. Now, I am in it. The only
slave in that big house in South Ridgefield is going to
be Obadiah. My dander is up, child, and I am going
to make him sweat. I must finish the job of training
which I started years ago. He never disobeyed me
then and he had better not try it now.&#8221; Her eyes
flashed and her manner was extremely menacing. &#8220;In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
the meantime,&#8221; she stormed, &#8220;he has brought you into
the world, which complicates matters but does not relieve
me of my responsibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second letter to Obadiah was in the hand of
Virginia but it breathed the words and spirit of his
sister Kate. It was an independent document. Every
line of it bristled with the spirit of &#8217;76. It regretted
his decision not to help in the case of Charles
Augustus and also that Virginia had not completed
her visit so that she could return to South Ridgefield.
In vague terms it referred to a home with her aunt,
and discussed a career, as well as certain positions for
teachers available in and about Old Rock.</p>

<p>Virginia copied the letter and signed her name.
Then she re-read with increasing alarm the ultimatum
which she had approved. Had she been alone it
would have been instantly destroyed; but under the
stern eye of her aunt she was helpless. Obediently
she addressed the envelope and, shaking way down in
her very boots, she watched her aunt fold, seal and
bear away for personal mailing the bolt which was to
be cast at her father&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>At the door Aunt Kate turned and, with the greatest
assurance, told the fear-shaken girl, &#8220;Mark my words!
This letter will make brother Obadiah sit up and take

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>OBADIAH &#8220;COMES TO&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>As it is written that a prophet is not without honor
save in his own country and in his own house, it is
deemed just that such matters as have to do with the
coming to pass of Aunt Kate&#8217;s prediction concerning
her brother Obadiah should be duly set forth herein
that they may be not suppressed through local jealousy.</p>

<p>Obadiah received Virginia&#8217;s letter late one afternoon
as he was about to return home. He did not immediately
read it, but carried it with him that he might
enjoy it in the greater seclusion of his own domicile.
What took place thereafter is best described in the
words of a confidential communication from Serena
to Ike. &#8220;Dat ole man is er ra&#8217;in&#8217; an&#8217; er ta&#8217;in&#8217; &#8217;roun&#8217;
in dyar jes lak sumpin done stung &#8217;im. It&#8217;s de badness
er wo&#8217;kin&#8217; out. De hot fiah o&#8217; to&#8217;ment singe &#8217;im an&#8217;
de cont&#8217;ary spi&#8217;it cry aloud fo&#8217; he&#8217;p lak er lamb afo&#8217;
er ragin&#8217; lion in de wilde&#8217;ness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike received these tidings concerning the spiritual
pass of his employer with an interest that lacked the
kindly sympathy which should be extended to a brother
struggling with the forces of evil. He made answer
in a casual manner, &#8220;Mr. Devil done run dat ole man
to ea&#8217;th er long time ergo. He jes er settin&#8217; back,
lafin sof&#8217; to hisse&#8217;f, er watchin&#8217; de houn&#8217;s er scratchin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
an&#8217; er clawin&#8217;. He gwine dig &#8217;im out presently. Ah
&#8217;spects dat de &#8217;pointed hour is at han&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>At dinner Obadiah was in a surly mood which he
vented upon Serena by making cutting criticisms concerning
the food and service. She received his comments
in silence, storing them up until a more propitious
hour of reckoning. Meanwhile she solaced
herself by certain outbursts at Ike.</p>

<p>Unconscious of impending disaster, the chauffeur
had seated himself adjacent to the range. Here he
rested from the labors of the day, having in view a
tempting repast of chicken and sweet potatoes. He
endeavored by agreeable conversation, to make smooth,
or grease if you wish, its pathway to his stomach.
&#8220;Miss Sereny, yo&#8217;all is er movin&#8217; mighty peart dis
evenin&#8217;,&#8221; he remarked in tuneful tones, as the old
negress hastily re-entered the kitchen, severely wounded
by a barbed dart of Obadiah&#8217;s temper.</p>

<p>She whirled upon him and snapped, &#8220;Shet up dat
big mouf. Yer &#8217;minds me o&#8217; er ole alligator er settin&#8217;
thar workin&#8217; yer jaws an&#8217; ain&#8217; say nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>A glance at Serena&#8217;s face showed Ike that storm signals
were unmistakably flying. He thought to assuage
the tempest by the tender of assistance. &#8220;Caint
ah he&#8217;p you, Miss Sereny? Ah &#8217;spects dat yo&#8217;all is
plum ti&#8217;ed er wo&#8217;kin&#8217; in dis yere hot kitchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fixed him with smoldering eyes. &#8220;He&#8217;p me,
he&#8217;p me,&#8221; she repeated indignantly. &#8220;De onlies way
er lazy nocount lummox lak yo&#8217;all kin he&#8217;p me is by
er movin&#8217; yer triflin&#8217; carcass out o&#8217; ma kitchen stid o&#8217;
layin&#8217; &#8217;round ma stove lak er houn&#8217; dawg. Lif youse&#8217;f
off dat chair, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>Ike, the indirect victim of Virginia&#8217;s letter, removed
himself in haste from his comfortable corner and retired
to the cool steps of the back stoop, to allow the
domestic cyclone to blow itself out before attempting
again to procure his evening&#8217;s nourishment.</p>

<p>Obadiah had an uncomfortable night. A remembrance
of the lance like thrusts of Aunt Kate, which,
in the name of his daughter, had so cruelly lacerated
him in spite of his armor of egotism, drove sleep away.
Tossing upon a bed of discomfort, he heard the clocks
toll out each passing hour until, weary and tired eyed,
he left his bed, ill prepared to face the burdens and
perplexities of the new day.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Serena served Obadiah efficiently; but
her attitude was hostile. The wounds of the proceeding
night were yet raw. When he had eaten, she faced
him sternly and demanded, &#8220;When is yo&#8217;all &#8217;spectin&#8217;
Miss Virginy is er gwine come home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of these days,&#8221; he answered with indifference.</p>

<p>She was not to be thus summarily dismissed. &#8220;Dat
day bettah be er comin&#8217; mighty quick,&#8221; she threatened.
&#8220;Ah is er gittin ti&#8217;ed er waitin&#8217; &#8217;roun&#8217; yere. Presen&#8217;ly,
ah gwine pack ma duds an&#8217; go whar she at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You attend to your own business,&#8221; he snarled petulantly.</p>

<p>His irritation was an elixir of strength to her.
Hands on hips she gazed defiantly at him. &#8220;Ma business
is whar Miss Virginy is. Ah ain&#8217; promise Miss
Elinor dat ah tek care o&#8217; yo&#8217;all. Ah gives ma word
to watch dat chil&#8217;. Ef you is er countin&#8217; on me er
stayin&#8217; in dis yere house yo&#8217;all bettah git dat gal back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
quick. Ah ain&#8217; got no time fo&#8217; no man so se&#8217;fish dat &#8217;is
own kin folk done turn again &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the righteous indignation of his own servant
Obadiah fled from his dining room, speechless
with indignation.</p>

<p>He entered his office at nine o&#8217;clock. The sound of
Mr. Jones&#8217;s typewriter should have greeted him and
he should have perceived Kelly recording profits in the
great ledgers. This morning their seats were vacant.
There was a lonesomeness about the place distasteful
to the manufacturer. His sleepless night and the altercation
with Serena had caused him to develop a fit
of indigestion which was not allayed by the lack of
punctuality on the part of his heretofore punctual subordinates.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded in the hallway, also happy laughter.
Tardy employees approached their work joyously,
not stealthily, as is the normal custom of such
miscreants. No cheery smile of cordial welcome mantled
Obadiah&#8217;s face. No well turned quip, to amuse
his minions in their hours of toil, was upon his lip.
He sternly awaited the coming of these frivolous and
delinquent workers.</p>

<p>As Mr. Jones and Kelly entered, there were glad
smiles upon their faces. There was something different
about the stenographer. There was a marked outward
change in him. His clear complexion proclaimed
good health. He carried himself as if in complete
control of his muscles. In place of awkwardness had
come a distinct grace of carriage.</p>

<p>There were more subtle changes in Mr. Jones, also.
A clearness of eye, a steadiness of gaze and a quiet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
self-confidence were a novelty to his friends of other
days.</p>

<p>But, strangest of all, the private secretary&#8217;s old time
beauty was marred by a discoloration of the right
eye, poorly disguised with powder, by several small
cuts upon his face and by certain bandages on his
hands.</p>

<p>Obadiah gave Mr. Jones a sweeping glance which
failed to grasp details essential to a clear understanding
of a subordinate. &#8220;What do you mean, loafing
in here at noon?&#8221; he demanded most inaccurately,
&#8220;I pay you to get here at nine o&#8217;clock. What does
this mean?&#8221; The cruel glance of Obadiah&#8217;s eye
pierced the optic of Mr. Jones as if to plumb the depths
of his soul and wrest his innermost secrets forth to
be exposed, naked and ashamed, in the pitiless light of
publicity.</p>

<p>The mill owner&#8217;s efforts to read the stenographer&#8217;s
mind through the eye were futile. Had he succeeded,
the result of his research would have shocked him.
Believing himself to be peeping into the eyes of a
turtle dove, he would have become aware that he
might, with greater safety, have attempted to stare
down the baleful glare of a Bengal tiger.</p>

<p>Lacking in the ability to read the human mind,
Obadiah could not know that Fate, seeking a recipient
for her favor, had plucked a peaceful soul from in
front of a typewriter and made it fierce.</p>

<p>Had the manufacturer been able to view Mr. Jones&#8217;s
mind as the scenes of a movie, he would have beheld
thrilling events taking place upon the previous evening.
He would have observed his stenographer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>
simply arrayed in trunks, socks and shoes, with eight
ounce gloves laced upon his hands, give battle for the
feather-weight championship of the Fifth ward, before
a multitude of wildly excited male citizens.</p>

<p>Had Obadiah by similar means reviewed the mind of
Kelly, he would have watched the battle as through
the eyes of a second. He would have seen, beneath
the electric lights, the muscles of the little fighting men
play, panther like, under the healthy pink of their
skins. If one drop of red blood remained in his
anæmic old body, the mill owner would have thrilled
as Mr. Jones, his arms playing smoothly as well oiled
connecting rods, treading upon his toes softly as a
cat, advanced, retreated and side stepped, ever warily
studying the face of his opponent. He would have
perceived that his stenographer ducked and dodged
with incredible swiftness, his gloved hands playing
always to feign, to ward and to deliver blows which
resounded with the thud of leather against quivering
flesh. Obadiah&#8217;s eyes would have recognized the rich
red of blood smearing the marble of human flesh, and
he would have tingled at the excitement of the spectators
when, rising from their seats, they tumultuously
applauded the giver of a lucky blow.</p>

<p>Through five gruelling rounds of fighting the manufacturer
would have followed the fortunes of his private
secretary until that final moment when, panting
and heaving, he stood over the prone form of his adversary,
counting the motions of the referee&#8217;s hands,
whose voice could not be heard above the thunderous
applause which acclaimed him victor.</p>

<p>But no picture of this battle could have told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
Obadiah that in the moment of triumph the spirit of Mr.
Jones was reborn; that from the building, into the portals
of which he had been almost dragged by Kelly,
he had come forth a red-blooded fighting man whose
gore had mixed with that of his antagonist.</p>

<p>Ignorant of these happenings, Obadiah angrily
awaited an answer from his unpunctual servants.</p>

<p>The smile had faded from the face of Mr. Jones at
Obadiah&#8217;s rough greeting. He failed to behave in accord
with the best usages among private secretaries.
Squaring his shoulders, he took a deep breath, thereby
greatly straining a gusset only recently let into the back
of his vest. Suddenly he shoved his head forward.
As his face advanced, it changed into an ugly countenance
with a nasty eye, such an one as would make
its recipient ill at ease. This was Mr. Jones&#8217;s fighting
face, developed with care under the kindly advice of
Kelly. Sporting characters considered it a valuable
asset.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones&#8217;s expression startled Obadiah. For
years, when at a loss for words or thoughts, he had
studied the lamb like face of his stenographer. That
timid look was gone now, replaced by a countenance
which had borrowed coldness from the glance of a
rattlesnake and combined it with a grizzly bear&#8217;s cruelty
of aspect. To Obadiah it spoke of arson, of
the assassination of capitalists, of the proletariat running
mad. He quailed before it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you get that noon stuff?&#8221; snarled Mr.
Jones.</p>

<p>Obadiah turned towards the clock as if to place the
blame for any misstatements of time upon that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
instrument. The hands pointed to five minutes past nine
thereby also indicating their owner to be a liar.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Jones spoke. Roughness replaced refinement.</p>

<p>&#8220;For five years I have worked overtime for you,
two or three afternoons a week, sometimes fifteen
minutes, sometimes an hour. I also put in many an
evening and some Sundays for you. I never received
a word of thanks for it. Now, because I am delayed
by important business and come in five minutes late,
you put up a squeal as if I&#8217;d stepped on your sore corn.
Say, what kind of a cheap skate are you?&#8221; the stenographer
roared in conclusion.</p>

<p>Obadiah ignored the question in haughty but uneasy
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so much of your ugly old self that you
can&#8217;t think of anything else. But believe me, everybody
else has got your number and they&#8217;re wasting no
time loving you. Say,&#8221; growled Mr. Jones so roughly
that Obadiah jumped, &#8220;have you a friend in the
world?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant it appeared that the manufacturer
contemplated a hurried retreat from his own office, but
the pugnacious stenographer barred the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hain&#8217;t,&#8221; announced Mr. Jones ungrammatically
but emphatically, producing a gigantic roll of
currency from his pocket. It was his share of the
fight receipts, and, although the denominations averaged
low, it bulked large to the surprised eyes of
Obadiah. Mr. Jones shook the money in the face
of his employer. &#8220;See that?&#8221; he inquired, as if suspecting
that his employer suffered from failing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
eyesight. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to hold it too near to you or you
might try to pinch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah viewed the roll of bills with a repugnance
astounding in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to work to get that money, last night,&#8221; Mr.
Jones continued. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the easy kind of money
that you pull down. But that isn&#8217;t the point. Kelly
and I have bought a gymnasium up the street. We intended
to treat you fair&#8211;to give you full notice so
that you could fill our places before we left. But as
you&#8217;ve had to be a little meaner than usual this morning,
I think we&#8217;ll bid you good-bye right now. How
about it, Kelly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say we will,&#8221; agreed that successful trainer with
emphasis, and he and the fighter abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>Obadiah closed the door of the office with a resounding
slam behind his departing staff and, taking
a bunch of unopened letters from Mr. Jones&#8217;s former
place of labor, he bore them into his own lair. As he
sank down behind his desk he thumbed them over and,
selecting one, opened and read the paper it contained.
It was a formal order from the State Board of Health
forbidding the further discharge of waste from the
dye house at his mill into the Lame Moose River. As
the manufacturer grasped the import of the document,
his face purpled with rage and the paper shook in his
hands. Finally he petulantly cast it aside and groaned
aloud at a twinge of indigestion. Dropping back in
his chair he took Virginia&#8217;s letter from his pocket and
re-read it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had bad luck ever since she left,&#8221;
he growled. &#8220;Things don&#8217;t break right. I can&#8217;t keep
my mind on my business. She must come home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
Unhooking his telephone, he asked Hezekiah Wilkins
to come to him.</p>

<p>Hezekiah responded, smiling pleasantly. &#8220;Good
morning,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What has happened to the
boys? Not sick, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fired them,&#8221; Obadiah rapped. &#8220;They were too
fresh around here and I let them go.&#8221; His anger and
resentment displayed itself. &#8220;They are no good. I
wouldn&#8217;t give them recommendations as dog catchers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hump,&#8221; ejaculated Hezekiah. &#8220;Both at once?
It leaves you short handed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah invited the attention of his attorney to
business by handing him the order of the Board of
Health.</p>

<p>Hezekiah read the document with care and, returning
it to the manufacturer, gazed at the ceiling reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of it?&#8221; Obadiah&#8217;s manner
was short.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been expecting it,&#8221; the lawyer replied with
calmness. &#8220;What else could you expect? You are
ruining the water that people have to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be forced. They won&#8217;t drive me,&#8221; Obadiah
maintained with his usual obstinacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll drive you into court fast enough, if you
don&#8217;t obey that order,&#8221; Hezekiah warned him with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just where I want to be. It&#8217;s up to you
to develop a plan to flim-flam that bunch of fool doctors.
You&#8217;re losing your &#8216;pep&#8217; or you&#8217;d have worked
out something before this,&#8221; sneered Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am losing my &#8216;pep,&#8217;&#8221; Hezekiah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
mimicked, and his eyes flashed as he went on. &#8220;I have
enough mental alertness left to advise you not to bite
off your nose to spite your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah flushed angrily but controlled his temper.
&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he snarled, &#8220;while I tell you what I pay
you to tell me. The Lame Moose is a navigable
stream, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah nodded, his eyes dancing with amusement.</p>

<p>Obadiah frowned at his attorney and continued,
&#8220;We&#8217;ll raise a federal question and get the case into
the U. S. Courts and with dilatory pleas, continuances
and appeals it will take years before a final decision is
handed down. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah laughed. &#8220;As your legal adviser, I can&#8217;t
approve it. The waste from the dye-house at your
mill is spoiling the water that some thousands of people
have to drink. There is a simple remedy open to
you but they have none. Common justice demands
that you consider the rights of these beings.&#8221; The attorney
turned loose his oratorical voice. &#8220;Common
justice demands it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manufacturer flushed and shifted uneasily.
Quarrelsome as he was, he could not afford a break
with this man.</p>

<p>Hezekiah relapsed into a careful study of the metal
cornice over the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think it over. Think about it,&#8221; snapped Obadiah
after a moment&#8217;s silence. &#8220;You may be able to catch
my point of view. I have another subject which I
want to discuss with you&#8211;an embarrassing personal
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah gave him a covert glance but immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>
resumed inspection of the metal work across the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about my daughter,&#8221; continued Obadiah. &#8220;I
have a letter from her which I wish you to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah perused Virginia&#8217;s letter with great care
and attention. &#8220;Did she write that?&#8221; he asked
abruptly, as he returned the communication.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in my daughter&#8217;s handwriting but I suspect
that my sister Kate may have had a hand in it. Virginia
never wrote such a letter to me before. It is an
unusual letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is an unusual letter,&#8221; Hezekiah agreed.
There was merriment in his eyes but otherwise he
presented the serious aspect befitting a counsellor in
the presence of a client. &#8220;It is an implied threat to
sever domestic relations. Such counsel as I give
should have in contemplation the facts which led up
to this&#8211;ahem&#8211;veiled ultimatum.&#8221;</p>

<p>This reasonable request embarrassed Obadiah
greatly; but after some hesitation he explained the circumstances
under which Virginia had left home as the
act of a defiant, headstrong girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, an exceedingly unfortunate matter,&#8221; exclaimed
Hezekiah, as if astonished at the revelation.
Therein his manner partook of deceit, as Hennie had
favored him so often with the details of the matter,
gathered from Virginia herself and more completely,
through Carrie, from Serena, that he knew them by
heart. The lawyer went on, &#8220;The adjustment of such
family differences requires tact&#8211;the utmost tact and
diplomacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The happenings of the morning had sorely inflamed
Obadiah&#8217;s indigestion. As he repeated his woes to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>
the attorney, remembrances of the lonely hours he
had spent since the girl&#8217;s departure came to him and
he believed himself a sadly ill-used man. Miserable
in body and spirit, he flamed into tempestuous rebellion
at the mild measures proposed by his legal adviser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tact and diplomacy the devil!!&#8221; he exploded.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll use force, if necessary. She is my daughter,
isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah gravely conceded Obadiah&#8217;s claim of
paternity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The law gives me some control of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As an unmarried woman, you have certain rights
over her,&#8221; Hezekiah admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, I want her back,&#8221; bellowed Obadiah, the
notes of his voice getting higher as the intensity of his
feeling increased. &#8220;You go and get her and make
her come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have in mind legal proceedings to compel
your daughter to return under your roof?&#8221; inquired
Hezekiah in a suave manner, in marked contrast
to the bluster of his employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difference how you do it.
Kidnap her for all I care. What I want is to get her
back,&#8221; the mill owner stormed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it occurred to you, that in such matters care
must be taken to avoid a serious rupture of those affectionate
relations which, after all, are the basis of
the home and the natural tie between a father and
daughter?&#8221; Hezekiah suggested quietly.</p>

<p>Obadiah&#8217;s face was swollen with passion, his obstinacy
written deep in it. &#8220;She must come home,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
he proclaimed. &#8220;I want her. I&#8217;m tired of living
alone. You go and make her come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smooth shaven countenance of the lawyer hardened.
His usual good-humored expression melted into
one of resolution as he said with great calmness, &#8220;I
have thought, sometimes, Obadiah, that you fail to
display a clear conception of an attorney&#8217;s duties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t appreciate the scope of my employment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that got to do with my daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has this. I do not conceive it my duty to force
your daughter to return to your home against her
wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You refuse to obey my instructions?&#8221; Obadiah
almost screamed, throwing discretion to the winds
in the tumult of his wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I refuse,&#8221; answered the lawyer, leaping to
his feet and talking down at his employer. &#8220;I refuse,&#8221;
he repeated in a voice in which passion found
no place, &#8220;as I have always refused when you would
have seduced me into doing an unjust act. There are
questions upon which fair minds may differ. Men of
honor may argue for the side in which they believe or
have been retained. From divers contentions, strongly
maintained, comes the bright star of right, shining
clear, in its purity, above the storm clouds of litigation.
But, Your Hon&#8211;&#8221; Hezekiah paused and began
anew&#8211;&#8220;But, sir, there are fundamental questions
involving moral law upon which right minded
men must agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this tirade got to do with me?&#8221; Obadiah
demanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>Hezekiah silenced the mill owner with a gesture of
great dignity. &#8220;Never interrupt counsel in the midst
of argument,&#8221; he protested, absently. &#8220;Undoubtedly
you will be afforded ample time to present your own
views.&#8221; He paused, blinking nervously. The interruption
had disturbed his train of thought, but in a
moment he continued. &#8220;At stated periods, prudent
merchants take trial balances and invoices that they
may know the condition of their business. It is likewise
well for men at times to take account of their
relations with their associates. It is my purpose to
do that now, Obadiah Dale.&#8221; In Hezekiah&#8217;s eyes was
a far away look now. &#8220;It&#8217;s nearly thirty years since
I entered your employ&#8211;thirty years, Obadiah, the
cream of my life. Its period of highest power I have
given to you. My life must be judged by my accomplishments
for you. You and I alone know what part
my judgment has had in the development of your
great business. As a young man, I liked you, Obadiah.
I admired your energy and perseverance and that combativeness
which made you give battle in open competition
for new fields of commercial activity. Success
came to you in a measure permitted to but few,
and the tremendous power of wealth accompanied it.
Thoughts come to me of your wife, that fair rose of
the Southland, who not only brought sunshine into
your own house but spread it among all those who
were privileged to know her. In her you were a twice
blessed man. A daughter was born to you, the image
of her mother, and so were you thrice blessed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah&#8217;s face became stern. &#8220;I have tried to
judge you fairly at the bar of my heart, Obadiah.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>
Old friendship has pleaded for you. Unhappiness
over the loss of your wife may have swayed you. Yet,
something tells me that you were always the man that
you have been of late, concealing the evil in you that
you might the better court success. At any rate, there
has been a gradual outward change in you until here
and now&#8221;&#8211;Hezekiah was very grave&#8211;&#8220;I impeach
you before the high court of my heart for divers crimes
and offenses, treasonable in their nature, against the
good will and happiness of your fellowmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner at the bar gave a start, possibly remembering
that the historical punishment for treason
was the headsman&#8217;s axe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have hardened, Obadiah,&#8221; the lawyer continued
relentlessly, &#8220;until you have grown as icy cold
as the winter hills of your native lands. You have
become cruel and rapacious in your business dealings.
Of late years your commercial pathway is strewn with
the wrecks of enterprises, which in no sense affected
your own safety but which you have ruined through
a sheer desire to dominate, a naked lust for power.
Controlled by greed and avarice, no generous thought
for your fellowmen actuates you. Steeped in your
own selfishness, you sit in this room like&#8211;&#8221; shaking
a forefinger at Obadiah the attorney hesitated, seeking
a fitting condemnatory simile. Suddenly he concluded&#8211;&#8220;like
a fat hog,&#8221; and struck the desk of the
alleged swine such a thump that the pork jumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your memory will tell you how many times I have
blocked your devilish schemes by convincing you that,
if persisted in, the anti-trust laws must land you behind
prison bars.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>Hezekiah in the pose of a stout statue of liberty,
thrust up his right arm and clasped his left hand to
his breast. He fixed accusing eyes upon the manufacturer
and cried in a big voice, &#8220;If the world knew as
much about you as I do, I am not so sure but they&#8217;d
incarcerate you under the first law of nature&#8211;self-preservation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; Obadiah paled visibly and with great
nervousness viewed the open transom.</p>

<p>Hezekiah leveled an arraigning hand at his employer.
&#8220;Your actions should be such that you could rest in
equanimity while they are cried aloud in the market
places. The hour of reckoning is at hand, Obadiah.
You believe yourself invincible. Blinded by a curtain
of obstinacy you have not read your destiny. I tear
it aside and expose your dark future. Your daughter,
beautiful and affectionate, filled, as was her mother,
with thoughts of others, discovers your true character
and, turning from you, prefers the peace of a good
conscience amidst humbler surroundings to a home of
wealth in your company. She leaves you&#8211;alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah winced.</p>

<p>Hezekiah returned to his task with renewed vigor.
&#8220;This morning your personal staff&#8211;men who have
been with you for years&#8211;separate from you. I have
no hesitation in assuming that they departed rankling
beneath injustice. They leave you&#8211;alone. Now
your attorney&#8221;&#8211;Hezekiah&#8217;s voice was filled with
feeling&#8211;&#8220;your adviser for years, tenders his resignation
rather than to be a party to enforcing your selfish
demands against your own daughter. He leaves you&#8211;alone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>Stunned by this unexpected shot, Obadiah appeared
to shrink in his chair.</p>

<p>Highly pleased at the effect and sound of his own
words, Hezekiah seized upon the order of the Board
of Health and, shaking it in the face of the mill owner,
waxed ever more eloquent. Floating away upon the
wings of his own fervid oratory, he continued in ringing
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;The keen eye of this great Commonwealth has
found you out. Now does its strong right arm,
the law, reach forth to protect the weak and restrain
the strong. In ardent pursuit of evil it draws ever
nearer and nearer, until at last it embraces even the
waste&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hezekiah stopped short. A look of horror, loathing
and disgust swept his countenance. He was inexpressibly
shocked at the extraordinary conclusion to which
his simile hastened.</p>

<p>To Obadiah, the repugnance in Hezekiah&#8217;s face depicted
antipathy towards himself. For years the attorney
had been the manufacturer&#8217;s one friend. He
had admired the lawyer&#8217;s learning and leaned upon
his judgment. For years he had known that words
were playthings in his legal adviser&#8217;s mouth; but that
look was too much. The aversion and detestation displayed
crushed the mill owner. Humbled to the dust
he reviewed the calamities which Hezekiah had so ably
painted. With due allowance for rhetorical exaggeration,
they frightened him. He must save Hezekiah
to pilot him through the darkness.</p>

<p>Sick and weary and miserable but above all else
lonely, Obadiah arose from his desk and confronted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
the lawyer. &#8220;Hezekiah, you will not leave me?&#8221; he
begged, in pitiful humiliation, his anger gone.</p>

<p>The placid Hezekiah was shaken to the depths of
his soul at the catastrophe which had befallen him.
Vain of his oratorical ability, he regarded his address
to Obadiah as a worthy effort until his final bull.
Such slips are remembered by one&#8217;s professional
brethren until the end of one&#8217;s life. He took his grievance
out on the abased Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; he growled, &#8220;tired of your greed and
selfishness, tired of your confounded pigheadedness
and the continual scrap in which you live. You&#8217;re old,
Obadiah. I bet you ten dollars that the hearse is in
use which will haul you to the cemetery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah shuddered and displayed no disposition to
take the wager.</p>

<p>Hezekiah went on testily. &#8220;You worry about
money until every one hates and despises you. It&#8217;s
bad for my reputation to work for you&#8211;to be caught
in your company. I have saved enough to keep me
comfortable until I die and I&#8217;m going to take it easy.
I want to quit fighting law suits and go to compromising.&#8221;
A glint of his usual humor flashed in Hezekiah&#8217;s
eyes. &#8220;If you&#8217;d let me compromise your cases,
I might stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah made a quick motion as of consent.</p>

<p>Hezekiah viewed his shaking employer with great
severity. &#8220;You must prove your conversion by your
works,&#8221; he rapped. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to show me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I do, Hezekiah?&#8221; the manufacturer,
looking helpless and old, begged. &#8220;Give me the benefit
of your advice.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span>&#8220;Do?&#8221; snapped Hezekiah petulantly. &#8220;Decide
how you think a thing ought to be done and do the opposite.
You&#8217;re always wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please be specific, Hezekiah.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the word &#8220;please,&#8221; the lawyer started in surprise.
In a moment he growled, &#8220;Compromise.
Learn to consider the rights and wishes of other people.
The compromise is a most valuable instrument
in bringing about domestic happiness,&#8221; and with this
sage advice, Hezekiah, the bachelor, left his employer.</p>

<p>Stricken low by physical disorder and verbal assaults,
it was a day of gloomy forebodings to Obadiah.
After Hezekiah&#8217;s oration, the path ahead, usually certain
and clear to him, seemed beset with obstacles and
lined with eyes of hatred.</p>

<p>When he went home that night there seemed to be
a stoop in his usually erect carriage and a deep anxiety
dwelt in his eyes. Hardly touching his dinner, he
sat through it, in his dining room, plunged in thought.</p>

<p>Serena marked the change in the behavior of her employer
with great interest. Returning to the kitchen,
she told Ike, &#8220;Mr. Devil done sna&#8217;ah dat ole man wid
er bait o&#8217; shinin&#8217; gol&#8217;. Now he gwine hawg tie &#8217;im

to git outen de sn&#8217;ah, as de hot i&#8217;on burns &#8217;im an&#8217; de
brimstone smoke choke &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chauffeur, being for the moment in high favor,
was enjoying a piece of pie as a fitting appetizer for
his later dinner. &#8220;He ain&#8217; lif&#8217; up his voice in prah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328'></a>328</span>
or mek no sign er tall,&#8221; responded the youth, giving
close attention to the pastry and but little heed to the
demoniacal trapping going on in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey&#8217;s er fightin&#8217; ete&#8217;nally, boy,&#8221; explained Serena
with scorn.</p>

<p>Ike rolled his eyes, exposing large areas of white until
they rested upon the woman. &#8220;Ain&#8217; you mek er
mistake, Miss Sereny?&#8221; he suggested respectfully.
&#8220;Ain&#8217; you mean infe&#8217;nally?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look yere, boy,&#8221; she retorted with great dignity,
&#8220;ah ain&#8217; er astin&#8217; no trash lak yo&#8217;all to teach me nothin&#8217;.
Ah gits ma &#8217;ligion f&#8217;om de good book in de chu&#8217;ch
house. Min&#8217; you&#8217; own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah retired early and again tossed backwards
and forwards through long hours. Hezekiah had indeed
torn aside a concealing veil from the manufacturer&#8217;s
life. Obadiah was not a man given to introspection,
but, for the first time in years, the words of
his attorney had forced it upon him. Tonight his
boasted accomplishments were nothing, while episodes
which he would have gladly forgotten loomed large.
Above all else a great loneliness and fear of the future
crushed him.</p>

<p>In this hour of deepest humility, recollections of his
wife and the far away days of his married life came
to him. Sweet and tender memories these, of occurrences
almost forgotten. He softened to them, and moments
followed when it was as if the spirit of Elinor
Dale had crossed the span of years and labored with
the troubled soul of the selfish, obstinate, purse-proud
old rich man until at last, Obadiah&#8211;slept in peace.</p>

<p>When he appeared in the morning, a change had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span>
taken place in him. There was strength and decision
in his face; but it seemed as if the lines of cruelty and
obstinacy were altered and smoothed away as the ruts
and tracks upon a sandy beach after a great storm.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330'></a>330</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>HIS JOURNEY&#8217;S END</span></h2>

<p>Excitement prevailed in the home of Aunt Kate in
Old Rock. There was a soft sound of feminine feet
rushing about. Much searching for mislaid articles
of apparel was taking place and those hastening made
nervous demands for assistance upon those hurrying.</p>

<p>The disturbance in this peaceful household was due
to the receipt of knowledge that Charles Augustus and
his mother had returned from New York during the
preceding night. Preparations were now in progress
for the departure of Virginia and Helen to greet the
returned ones in a fitting manner.</p>

<p>At last the two girls were appropriately garbed and
Aunt Kate kissed them good bye at the front door and,
with a kindly smile upon her face, watched them run
across the meadow towards the pond, making farewell
signals with their canoe paddles.</p>

<p>An hour later there was a sharp rap of the old fashioned
knocker on the front door. &#8220;Mercy sakes upon
us,&#8221; muttered Aunt Kate. &#8220;What business has anybody
coming here at this time of day?&#8221; A look of
aversion crept over her face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet my boots it is
an agent or a peddler. I&#8217;ll send him packing pretty
quick with a flea in his ear.&#8221; Apparently bent upon
carrying out this peculiar attention she hurried into the
hall. Bending low, she pulled aside the curtain of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span>
side light and peered out. The feet and legs before
her advertised their owner as a man. &#8220;It is a peddler,&#8221;
she murmured. Her gentle face assumed a stern and
forbidding aspect. Suddenly, she jerked the door
open and, glowering at the intruder, cried, &#8220;Go away!
I don&#8217;t want&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The victim of this unusual reception was her
brother Obadiah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land o&#8217; Goshen, how you frightened me, Obadiah
Dale,&#8221; Aunt Kate reproached him as soon as she recovered
from her surprise. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know any
better than to scare a body half to death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend to frighten you, Kate,&#8221; Obadiah
protested, when he got over his own astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bad place is paved with good intentions,&#8221; she
quoted with sternness and, as her brother hesitated upon
the porch, puzzled at his extraordinary greeting, she
commanded, &#8220;Come in. What are you waiting out
there for? Must I lead you in?&#8221; Giving him a ceremonious
kiss, she ushered him into the large back room
where the table prepared for luncheon reminded her to
be hospitable. &#8220;Have you had breakfast, Obadiah?
I&#8217;ll fix you something in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, on the train. I don&#8217;t want anything to eat,
Kate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfied that her brother was not starving, she gazed
at him over the tops of her spectacles with a humorous
twinkle in her eyes. &#8220;This <i>is</i> a surprise. It is the
first time that you have visited me since&#8211;&#8221; She
paused in sudden indignation. &#8220;Obadiah Dale,&#8221; she
went on sharply, &#8220;you have never deigned to honor
me with a visit in my own home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>He was nervous and ill at ease as he answered, &#8220;I
know, Kate, but I&#8217;m a very&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She interrupted him, in a gentler mood. &#8220;Yes, I
know, Obadiah. The years have run swiftly. Yesterday
we were boy and girl together at the old home.
Today we are old folks, the best part of our lives
spent. The page of our earthly hour is nearly written
and there is only room for a few more sentences.&#8221;
She glared at him with great severity and sniffed,
&#8220;At least, we&#8217;d better see that these lines have something
good about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Kate,&#8221; he agreed meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you want to see&#8211;Virginia. She&#8217;s
not here, Obadiah. She has gone up to the head of
the pond to see Charles Augustus, the lame boy who
was operated upon,&#8221; she told him.</p>

<p>Obadiah nodded. &#8220;How far is that from here?
Can I walk it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Kate considered. &#8220;It&#8217;s about three miles
by road. You will get lost and never find the place.
The girls will be back by two or three o&#8217;clock. Can&#8217;t
you make yourself comfortable and visit with me until
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do want to see Virginia. She has been away a
long time.&#8221; He jumped to his feet and moved nervously
about. &#8220;I think that I shall walk there, if you
don&#8217;t mind, Kate.&#8221;</p>

<p>His anxiety awakened the sympathy of his sister.
&#8220;You are not used to strolls like that. I am afraid
that it will not be good for you. I have a horse that
is old and fat and slow but he can haul us there if you
can hitch him up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span>&#8220;That will do.&#8221; Obadiah was much relieved. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
drive your horse. I used to do it when I was a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a long time ago. You may have forgotten.&#8221;
An idea struck her. &#8220;Do fashions change
in harness? If so, you won&#8217;t know a thing about it
and it won&#8217;t be safe to trust you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The employer of hundreds was disgusted at his sister&#8217;s
display of lack of confidence in his abilities.
&#8220;Harnesses haven&#8217;t changed,&#8221; he insisted, dryly.</p>

<p>At the barn, Archimedes was brought forth and
Obadiah Dale, millionaire manufacturer, essayed to
harness the steed to the family vehicle. He displayed
great energy and his enthusiasm increased with the
passage of time. Archimedes was an ideal animal for
the mill owner&#8217;s experimentations. In all of his impressive
dignity of weight and size, the animal waited
motionless while Obadiah buckled and unbuckled straps
in the making and correction of his errors. Minutes
passed and disaster threatened only when, in slipping
the bit between the massive teeth, a couple of the manufacturer&#8217;s
fingers inadvertently attended the linked
metal. Being asleep, the animal failed to take advantage
of it.</p>

<p>At last, Obadiah, viewing his handiwork with pride,
signified that all things were in readiness for the journey.
Aunt Kate had noted his prolonged efforts with
grave suspicion. She now approached Archimedes in
the critical mood of an irritated C. O. at Saturday
morning inspection. Obadiah took humble position,
two paces to her right and rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;That trace is twisted. Straighten it!&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>He corrected this oversight.</p>

<p>She surveyed the bridle and whirled upon him, horror
depicted in her eyes. &#8220;Obadiah Dale,&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;haven&#8217;t you any better sense than to take
your own sister driving without buckling the reins to
the bit. Lands sakes, I might have been dragged to
a terrible death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strange to relate, when this grave mistake had been
overcome and all things were in order; in spite of the
conclusive evidences of Obadiah&#8217;s incompetence, Aunt
Kate permitted him to drive. As she climbed into the
surrey, she announced, &#8220;I&#8217;ll sit back here where I can
get out if anything goes wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>This precaution as well as the general attitude of
his sister towards Archimedes, had persuaded Obadiah
that he had to do with a fractious steed, notwithstanding
that all outward appearances justified the conclusion
that Archimedes was a cow in soul and action.</p>

<p>The mill owner shoved open the sliding door of the
barn with an anxious eye upon the fat back as if fearful
that he might gallop wildly forth even as a fire
horse leaving a truck house in response to an alarm.</p>

<p>Archimedes never budged.</p>

<p>Obadiah climbed clumsily over the front wheel, the
reins hanging loosely from his hands. Seating himself,
he promptly drew them taut, prepared for any
emergency.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, Obadiah,&#8221; Aunt Kate warned him from
the back seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid-ap!&#8221; Obadiah spoke in a soothing voice
suitable to a high strung animal.</p>

<p>Archimedes held his ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span>Obadiah raised his voice in some degree, &#8220;Gid-ap!&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Archimedes might have been cast in a supporting
part in an equestrian statue for all the notice he took
of what transpired about him.</p>

<p>In vain Obadiah amplified his efforts. &#8220;This fool
horse is balky,&#8221; he grumbled to Aunt Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Archimedes balky, fiddle-de-dee,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s tied.&#8221; Past experience caused her to
examine the vicinity to be assured that through inadvertence
they were not made fast to anything by
chains or cables. Suddenly, she became aware of
Obadiah&#8217;s firm rein. &#8220;No wonder!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;You are holding him too tight. You don&#8217;t know
how to drive. Give me the lines.&#8221; Leaning forward
over the back of the front seat Aunt Kate seized the
reins and gave three or four swinging pulls as a conductor
signaling to the engineman ahead. Simultaneously
she made clicking sounds with her lips reminiscent
of swine enjoying a milky repast.</p>

<p>Archimedes responded readily to this treatment and
moved slowly forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; Aunt Kate said with great satisfaction as
she returned the reins to Obadiah. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way
to drive a horse.&#8221; As they turned out of the driveway
into the road, she warned him, &#8220;Do be careful of the
automobiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I be careful of them? Can&#8217;t they
take care of themselves up here?&#8221; he demanded, meanwhile
tugging at the reins, and then, &#8220;Who broke this
fool horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Kate leaned forward. &#8220;Where?&#8221; she asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336'></a>336</span>
with great anxiety only to quickly drop back into her
seat with a suppressed, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of the efforts of the mill owner, the steed
drifted gradually towards the gutter.</p>

<p>&#8220;This horse isn&#8217;t bridlewise,&#8221; Obadiah declared
in disgust. &#8220;I might as well be trying to drive a
cow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has more sense than lots of people I know,&#8221;
Aunt Kate answered with a meaning look at her
brother. &#8220;He wants to get out of the way of automobiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few minutes Archimedes was permitted to
follow the way of the gutter in peace, then, &#8220;This is
ridiculous,&#8221; protested Obadiah. &#8220;I feel like a perfect
idiot driving this way. I&#8217;ll be hanged if I&#8217;ll do
it.&#8221; He yanked and shouted at the horse until, fighting
every inch of the way, the animal drifted towards
the crown of the road.</p>

<p>With nervous eyes, Aunt Kate searched the highway
back of them for signs of approaching machines.
&#8220;Obadiah, look out. Here comes a car,&#8221; she screamed.</p>

<p>Alarmed at her tone, his body stiffened to meet the
shock of imminent collision. He jerked his head about
fearfully to perceive a car following them a mile away.
&#8220;Why did you startle me that way? I thought something
was about to hit us,&#8221; he blurted.</p>

<p>The horn of the approaching machine demanded the
road. Obadiah tugged at Archimedes anew. The
horse answered but slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, Obadiah, they are running into us,&#8221;
screamed Aunt Kate.</p>

<p>The mill owner redoubled his efforts to get out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>
the way as a series of frantic squawks and the grind
of brakes sounded from behind them.</p>

<p>In desperation, Obadiah jerked out the whip and
gave Archimedes a smart clip. The horse bounded
clumsily and stopped in the middle of the road. The
petted animal&#8217;s astonishment at this treatment was such
that he had to pause for consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you strike my horse that way,&#8221; cried Aunt
Kate indignantly, her mind diverted from the menacing
automobile by the punishment of her property.
&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah put up the whip, leaving the motionless
Archimedes to meditate upon his injuries in the center
of the highway while the automobile worked its
way around. It came opposite to them, a flivver of
the cheapest type&#8211;mere dust beside Obadiah&#8217;s own
car.</p>

<p>A rough, angry man glared at the mill owner and
bawled, &#8220;You old moss-back, do you think that you
own this road? When somebody takes a wheel off of
that old ark, it may&#8221;&#8211;the voice was very doubtful&#8211;&#8220;knock
some sense into your bean. Don&#8217;t you know
enough to put out your hand when you stop, you mutton-headed
fool. If there was a constable about I&#8217;d
have you chucked into the calaboose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah sat speechless under this insolence. Possibly
he was becoming inured to unkind words. As
the car disappeared in the distance his tongue was
loosened, &#8220;Kate, did you get their number?&#8221; he inquired
with great anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why on earth should I want their number?
I hope I never see them again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span>He almost stammered in the flood of his wrath. &#8220;If
I had it, I&#8217;d prosecute them&#8211;have them fined and
put in prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for&#8211;scolding us?&#8221; inquired Aunt Kate
softly.</p>

<p>He did not answer for a time. When he turned his
temper had departed. &#8220;Kate, I was wrong, I suppose,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously and there was affection
in her glance; but her voice was stern as she replied,
&#8220;Obadiah, you were headstrong and it led you into
trouble, as it used to when you were a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Kate.&#8221; In Obadiah&#8217;s tones was a new note.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Archimedes pursued his way in the safety
of the gutter until they turned into a little used lane
where great trees, decked in wonderful autumnal colors,
arched overhead, and unkempt hedges brushed their
wheels. The birds, disturbed in their preparations for
their trip South, made short, noisy flights ahead of the
vehicle, protesting against the intrusion.</p>

<p>Regardless of this, Obadiah and Archimedes, meditating
upon recent injuries, pursued the path that fate
would have them follow.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TRIUMPH</span></h2>

<p>When Virginia and Helen came up the path towards
the Curtis home, they missed the little figure of Charles
Augustus hobbling forth to meet them with joyous
greetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to the front door,&#8221; suggested Helen. So
they passed around the house and, ascending the steps,
knocked at the weather-beaten front entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; cried the shrill voice of Charles Augustus.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t open the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia obeyed the command of the child with a
smile of delight. As she swung the door back, the
pleasant odor of frying doughnuts assailed her nostrils.
Looking through the rooms, she could see Mrs. Curtis
in the kitchen, fork in hand, awaiting their entrance
with a look of inquiry which melted into a smile of
welcome as she recognized them.</p>

<p>In the midst of pillows, Charles Augustus sat in one
chair with his legs propped up upon another. As
usual, he was bright, cheerful and talkative.</p>

<p>Virginia turned towards the child and then she gave
a little gasp of joy as a big fellow with black eyes and
a wonderful smile lifted himself with a cane and limped
towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe!&#8221; she trilled, her sparkling blue eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span>
revealing her heart&#8217;s rejoicing. &#8220;Joe!&#8221; she repeated, in a
voice which breathed its own enchantment.</p>

<p>He was almost to her, his face alight with his happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe!&#8221; she whispered again, and gave a startled
glance of astonishment as this huge fellow with dancing
eyes stood upon one leg, balanced himself with his
cane and thrust forth an encircling arm. Rooted to
the spot, she could not evade it as it drew her to him
and, with fascinated eyes and curious thrills, she
watched his head bend slowly towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe&#8221;&#8211;this time it was the voice of his mother
speaking&#8211;&#8220;Where did you meet Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>His head went up and his arm dropped at his side.
Virginia released his arms which she had clutched and,
with reddened, telltale faces, they turned to Mrs. Curtis.</p>

<p>&#8220;We met in South Ridgefield, mother,&#8221; he told her,
and the girl gave an embarrassed nod of agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum,&#8221; said Mrs. Curtis. The utterance meant
little but her manner much. She disappeared only to
return in a moment with a plate of doughnuts and a
pitcher of milk. &#8220;Who is hungry?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Among the young people, famine stalked abroad.
In its relief, flushed faces regained their normal color
and Helen&#8217;s mischievous giggles were quieted sufficiently
for her to meet Joe with becoming gravity before
giving her attention to her own sweetheart.</p>

<p>But alas, the course of true love is never smooth.
Charles Augustus made energetic protest when he became
aware that Helen proposed to offer him nourishment
by hand after the manner in which infants but
recently weaned are treated. &#8220;Lemme be! My hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341'></a>341</span>
aren&#8217;t lame,&#8221; he objected. An unhappy look spread
over his face. &#8220;I get so tired sitting in this old chair.
Every little while, too, mother rubs my leg and works
it up and down. Ding bust it, that hurts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen, giving up her attempt to feed the boy, endeavored
to sooth and comfort him. &#8220;In a week or so
you will be running about without a sign of a crutch.
Think of that. Won&#8217;t that be fine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be out now,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Something
might happen to my hornet&#8217;s nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; Helen laughed. &#8220;Neither man
nor beast will interfere with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Miss Knight?&#8221; Virginia asked Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bossy as ever,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a good nurse and she was nice to you,
Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted with a chuckle; &#8220;but she is a
whole lot nicer to Mike Kelly these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was all interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as pleased with her as a snow bird at a blizzard.
Every time it was Miss Knight&#8217;s evening off,
he would make an early call upon me dressed in his
best clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a knock at the front door.</p>

<p>Hastening to it at a nod from Mrs. Curtis, Helen
threw it wide open. Aunt Kate and Obadiah waited
without.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; cried Virginia, for the moment blissfully
forgetful as she tried to get around Joe without hurting
his outstretched leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obadiah Dale!&#8221; It was Mrs. Curtis who spoke
from the doorway into the dining room and there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span>
something in her voice which held them all. The happiness
had gone from her face, leaving it cold and distorted
with passion as Virginia had seen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obadiah Dale!&#8221;&#8211;she fairly hissed the words&#8211;&#8220;What
do you want in my house? Would you like to
do me greater harm&#8211;you robber?&#8221; She gave a
shrill mirthless laugh and flung her hands towards the
sides of the poorly furnished room. &#8220;Look about you.
There isn&#8217;t much left since you got in your devil&#8217;s
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s eyes shifted to Virginia as, startled by
this strange attack upon her father, she waited at Joe&#8217;s
side. It was as if the woman struggled between aversion
and regard. &#8220;I never thought you were his
daughter,&#8221; she snarled.</p>

<p>White, tense and sickened to the depths of her being
by the fear of shameful disclosures, the girl could make
no reply.</p>

<p>Joe Curtis was watching his mother with worried
eyes. The frightened faces of Helen and Charles Augustus
peeped from behind Aunt Kate who, from the
subdued exclamations and the indignant glances she
gave her brother, was expecting to hear the worst of
him.</p>

<p>Clearly, Obadiah was amazed at the woman&#8217;s words.
He stood irresolute, his throat working as if he were
trying to swallow something. At last he regained the
power of speech. &#8220;Madam,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; sneered the woman, &#8220;Octavia Curtis, the
widow of Augustus Curtis, the man whose business
you ruined by your infernal scheming, whose wife and
two children were dragged by your greed and selfishness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span>
from a life of comfort&#8211;to this. What business
have you in my house, you thief?&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah flushed and quailed under her words. Bewildered
and puzzled, a guilty conscience in business
catastrophes made him feel it advisable to allow his
opponent to develop her case.</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s words affected Virginia differently.
Her face flushed and her fears passed. &#8220;Stop,&#8221; she
interrupted, her eyes flashing angrily. &#8220;What right
have you to speak so to my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right?&#8221; Again that ugly laugh came from Mrs.
Curtis as she urged, &#8220;Ask him how he ruined the Curtis
mill at Brenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obadiah gave a start.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate, observing her brother through suspicious
eyes, noted this. &#8220;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&#8221; she
quoted, for his greater comfort.</p>

<p>The mill owner glanced hastily towards the door as
if seeking a line of retreat from this assemblage of
women and lame men. But Aunt Kate, the inner
keeper of the outer gate, barred his way.</p>

<p>Pale of face but with a determined set to her mouth,
Virginia said softly, &#8220;Daddy, explain please. You
must Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a perfectly legitimate business deal. The
Curtis mill had notes upon the market, protected by
a mortgage on the plant. I purchased them. When
they became due and were not paid, to protect myself&#8211;and
you&#8211;I foreclosed and took the mill. I suppose
this woman was caught in the deal,&#8221; Obadiah answered
and moved as if to leave the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, Daddy,&#8221; the girl commanded. &#8220;We must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>
settle this matter now. Either too much or too little
has been said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Settle?&#8221; Once more that acrimonious laugh
came from Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s lips. &#8220;How are you going
to settle for sleepless nights, for worry and for tears?
What can pay for those dreary days which grew into
weeks and months since hope for my children was
torn from my life?&#8221; She flung her arms wide in
the anguish which tortured her. &#8220;How are you going
to wipe out the fact that my poor lame baby&#8221;&#8211;she
pointed at Charles Augustus&#8211;&#8220;had to depend
upon charity to be able to play as other boys&#8211;plain
charity,&#8221; she almost screamed. &#8220;Or that he&#8221;&#8211;she
indicated Joe&#8211;&#8220;has been forced into the world to
struggle for an education he might have had in comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; moaned Virginia. The misery of the story
clouded her eyes as they turned from the passion-torn
woman to her father.</p>

<p>The flood of the emotion-driven woman&#8217;s words
seemed to have made Obadiah helpless. He stood as
if awaiting sentence for his evil doing, an old man abject
and forlorn.</p>

<p>As she looked at him, a wave of pity swept over
Virginia and her love for him struggled in her heart,
regardless of all that had been said against him. &#8220;My
father can&#8217;t be to blame for all of this. I couldn&#8217;t
believe it of him,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>It was as if the note of grief and entreaty in the
girl&#8217;s voice tempered the anger of Mrs. Curtis. She
dropped into a chair and began to sob. Joe Curtis
arose hastily, limped over to her side, and tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span>
sooth her. At the sound of his mother&#8217;s grief, Charles
Augustus put his head upon Helen&#8217;s shoulder and wept
also.</p>

<p>Virginia moved over and gently touched the shoulder
of the sobbing woman, who, flinching from contact
with the girl&#8217;s hand, drew herself sharply away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, mother,&#8221; pleaded Joe.</p>

<p>Virginia withdrew her hand, yet she remained by
Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s chair. &#8220;Tell me the whole story,&#8221; she
begged. &#8220;I must know. I have the right to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even through her own grief, the anxiety and unhappiness
of the girl touched the older woman. She
raised her brimming eyes. Her temper had died away
and she spoke rapidly, almost in a monotone, broken
by sob hiccoughs. &#8220;At my husband&#8217;s death every
thing that he left me was invested in our mill. It was
a good business and should have given me and my boys
the comforts and even the luxuries of life. Before
his death, he had borrowed money to make improvements,
giving notes secured by a mortgage upon the
plant.</p>

<p>&#8220;After he had gone, I took charge of the mill and
tried to run it myself. I was not a very good business
woman. I had a hard time to pay the interest on our
indebtedness. When the notes came due, I asked for
a renewal but my request was refused. I was thunderstruck.
I learned that your father had bought the
notes, and wherever I tried to raise money I was refused
because of his influence as a rival manufacturer.
So I lost my mill and had to meet life, a widow with
a baby and a young boy, a little money, and this old
farm.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>A flash of her anger returned and she pointed at
Obadiah. &#8220;My boys are raised in poverty while <i>he</i>
stands there in the pride of his wealth. When he got
the mill he never used it. He closed it, throwing good
people who had worked for us for years out of employment.
They had to move away and sacrifice their
little homes. It brought sorrow to them as well as to
me. He, Obadiah Dale, is to blame for all of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Kate wiped a tear from her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; Virginia said softly, &#8220;did you know
the harm that you were doing to all of these people?&#8221;
Her eyes searched his, as if to discover his answer
before he could utter it, and her tones beseeched him
to justify her love at the altar of her heart.</p>

<p>Obadiah stiffened. He held up his head and returned
the look of his daughter squarely. He knew
that he was giving battle for her love, aye, even for
her respect. The old man was a fighter. &#8220;No!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;It is unjust to charge me with all of the
sorrows and tribulations of this family. I built the
first mill in this country&#8211;took the chances of opening
the industry. The Brenton mill was established
to compete with me. There was room for one big
plant here and only one. Augustus Curtis knew it and
expected to put me out of business. Mrs. Curtis&#8221;&#8211;Obadiah&#8217;s
voice was firm now&#8211;&#8220;you have said
some hard things about me today in the presence of
my daughter and sister. I am entitled in common
justice to my defence. I started in business without
a dollar. Much worse off, I think, than your husband.
Business has been a battle of supremacy with
me. I have taken hard licks and I have given them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span>
I have fought my way. Remember, I had to. A man
must win or lose in business and many are the weapons
used. I struck with the first one at hand and hit the
man in front of me. Do you blame a soldier for the
suffering of the dependents of those he kills in battle?
I think not. Mrs. Curtis,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you never
met me before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you recognize me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband pointed you out to me in South Ridgefield,&#8221;
she sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever advertise the fact that you were
running that mill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid to,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;I used my husband&#8217;s
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Obadiah to Virginia. &#8220;I had no
way of knowing that a woman was running the Brenton
mill. I plead guilty to fighting <i>men</i>. When I
get whipped I smile. When I put a man out of business
he starts another. He doesn&#8217;t sit down and cry
and blame me for what happens to his family ever
afterwards. I never fought a woman in all of my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, Obadiah. You used to talk back but
you never fought with me. I am afraid that you are
going to have to get a camel through a needle&#8217;s eye;
but you wouldn&#8217;t fight a woman,&#8221; interjected Aunt
Kate.</p>

<p>Obadiah disregarded his sister&#8217;s fears and went on,
&#8220;Did you ever hear of Dalton, the New York manufacturer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis nodded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span>&#8220;Five years ago, he started to put me out of business
by buying up the small mills and pooling them
against me. To protect myself, I bought negotiable
paper, covering mills in this locality wherever I could
get it. Where I could get control of the mills, I
did it. They were my competitors and would have
taken my business or combined against me gladly,&#8221;
Obadiah&#8217;s eyes rested anxiously upon the face of his
daughter as he concluded, &#8220;I was fighting Dalton,
a more powerful man than myself, not widows and orphans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s face had softened but there was yet a
question in her manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an old man,&#8221; Obadiah continued. &#8220;I find
that my ideas are changing and my view of life shifting.
I have believed that the accumulation of wealth
was everything. I know now that the happy man must
accumulate other things or he will find himself deserted
and miserable with his gold. In my life I have been
guilty of many wrongs. I would right those wrongs
if I could. Will you forgive me, Mrs. Curtis, for
unknowingly harming you and yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You explain your reasons for
loosening the forces which injured me; but there is
no regret in your heart. You&#8217;d do the same thing tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to his daughter. &#8220;At least, you understand
me, Virginia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you have done, Daddy; but Mrs.
Curtis has suffered, and she alone can wipe the slate
clean.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s face had saddened again, and as
she spoke it was as if she had forgotten that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span>
were others in the room. &#8220;Mother wouldn&#8217;t have
wanted you to make all of this unhappiness. You
brought sorrow and tears where she would have
wanted you to carry laughter and joy. I can&#8217;t judge
you fairly. How I have longed for you during the
past weeks and how I have wanted to go home. Unless
Mrs. Curtis can forgive you, Daddy, you haven&#8217;t
found mother&#8217;s way to settle this matter.&#8221; She gave
a queer strained little cry. &#8220;I can never go home with
you, Daddy, until you learn to follow her way,&#8221; she
sobbed, and dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>At the girl&#8217;s words, Mrs. Curtis had raised her eyes,
and as she listened her face softened. As Virginia
sank into the chair, the woman was beside her, petting
and soothing her.</p>

<p>It seemed as if his daughter&#8217;s words had taken
the very heart out of Obadiah. It was a haggard old
man bowed low with trouble who watched her, the
greatness of his longing written plain upon his lined
countenance.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Curtis moved towards him. &#8220;Obadiah
Dale&#8221;&#8211;she spoke so gently that it was hard
to recognize her as the one who had so recently flung
the accusations at him&#8211;&#8220;a moment ago I told you
that I could not forgive you. I was wrong. Your
daughter told you that it would have been her mother&#8217;s
way to have brought laughter and joy to me instead
of sorrow and tears. That which your daughter has
done for my son, Charles Augustus, fills my heart
with joy and brings laughter to my lips. She has
followed her mother&#8217;s way. I can&#8217;t believe that any
man altogether bad could be the father of such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>
daughter.&#8221; She held out her hand to him. &#8220;I forgive
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was at the office of the Board of Health,
yesterday, Virginia,&#8221; Joe announced, as one discussing
a topic of great personal interest, &#8220;I was told that
your father had agreed to keep the mill waste out of
the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a scream of delight, and a teary Virginia
launched herself into her father&#8217;s arms, giving happy
cries of endearment. In a moment she faced Mrs.
Curtis, and cried, &#8220;He&#8217;s perfectly grand. He&#8217;ll do
anything to right your wrongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Curtis smiled. &#8220;I think that we had better
let your father forget my troubles for a moment,&#8221; she
urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land sakes,&#8221; ejaculated Aunt Kate in a loud
whisper, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see that woman laugh. I was
afraid that she loved her troubles so much she wouldn&#8217;t
give them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, mother, she&#8217;ll hear you,&#8221; expostulated
Helen.</p>

<p>Thus repressed, Aunt Kate delivered a moral lesson
to Charles Augustus in a voice heard all over the room.
&#8220;It is easier to receive thanks for doing nice things,
Charles, than to have to beg forgiveness for doing
mean ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately Obadiah, diligently engaged at that moment
in erasing the past, was deaf to his sister&#8217;s remarks.
He told Mrs. Curtis, &#8220;I&#8217;ll re-open the Brenton
mill as soon as I can have it overhauled. I can
use it on some contracts I have. The profits shall be
yours. When you can repay the amount of the notes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span>
from them, I&#8217;ll transfer the mill back to you. If you
wish, I&#8217;ll buy it from you or rent it until your son is
capable of assuming charge of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He faced Joe and said, &#8220;I understand that you&#8217;ll
graduate from college this June. There&#8217;ll be a position
waiting for you in my mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In South Ridgefield?&#8221; Virginia inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>Obadiah gave his daughter a keen glance and then
stared at Joe appraisingly before he answered. &#8220;Yes,
in South Ridgefield, until his mother wants him to
take charge of her own business. By that time, if he
has brains and follows my plans for him, he should
be the finest young mill executive in this part of the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The youthful Charles Augustus came under the
mill owner&#8217;s eye. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that every expense connected
with the operation upon this young man is paid.
We don&#8217;t want outsiders in on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He perceived Helen. &#8220;Well, well, how you have
grown,&#8221; he declared in surprise. &#8220;You want to be
a teacher. I&#8217;ll send you to college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness knows, Obadiah,&#8221; protested Aunt Kate,
&#8220;a body would think it was Christmas.&#8221; She viewed
him doubtfully. &#8220;I am afraid that you were always
inclined to be a little extravagant.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the moment that his daughter embraced him,
happiness had filled the soul of the mill owner. The
difficulties of the past few days were forgotten. He
beamed at his sister, generosity oozing from every
pore. &#8220;Your house needs painting, Kate. I&#8217;ll have
it done. I&#8217;ll sell that plug of a horse you have and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352'></a>352</span>
buy you one that is broken or get you an automobile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop right there, Obadiah,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;I
have managed my affairs for years without your help.
When you talk about selling a horse like Archimedes,
I doubt your judgment. Look there!&#8221; She pointed
proudly through the window. &#8220;Who&#8217;d care to own
a finer horse than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as the assembled ones followed Aunt Kate&#8217;s
finger, Archimedes, wearied by the prolonged call,
gathered his feet beneath him and with a care for the
shafts evidencing practice, sank to the ground. From
this position of comfort, usually reserved by most well
bred horses for the privacy of the box stall, Archimedes
viewed his surroundings apparently with great
complacency.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353'></a>353</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>NOBODY HOME, MR. DEVIL</span></h2>

<p>The October night was clear, with a bite in the air
which foretold sharp frosts and winter&#8217;s snows. There
was no wind, only a great silence, as if all nature had
tucked itself away for a long night&#8217;s rest.</p>

<p>On the eastern horizon, there was a dull glow as if
it were the reflections of a great conflagration. The
light of it brightened, and slowly over the edge of
things arose a golden streak, the curved top of the
moon. In stately dignity, it ascended towards the
zenith, its gold changing to silver and its beams bathing
the world in a flood of gentle light. Over field
and forest and plain the soft veil advanced, spreading
its magic silvery sheen until all it touched became a
mysterious fairyland.</p>

<p>In this delicate mantle were enfolded the huts of
the poor and the palaces of the rich, the lonely dwelling
and the massed houses of great cities. The thriving
municipality of South Ridgefield was lighted by
this mild illumination which painted with a gleaming
brush the residence of Mrs. Henderson, and even
tinged the bald head of that learned lawyer, Hezekiah
Wilkins, who, seated upon the porch railing, gazed
heavenward and told the widow, &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful
moon, Mary. I have always admired the moon. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span>
the friend of youth. Since the beginning of time it
has been the one welcome third party at sentimental
trysts. If the moon were a gossip what stories it
could tell. What vows have been uttered in its presence
and signed and sealed&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And broken, Hezekiah?&#8221; suggested Hennie.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if the moon should turn tattletale, Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s blind or it would blush red
with shame for the fickleness of men,&#8221; Mrs. Henderson
told him and then went on, &#8220;Forget the moon and
tell me what you did for Virginia that worked this
miracle?&#8221;</p>

<p>He chuckled. &#8220;It was so easy. I told Obadiah
that he made me think of a fat hog. As usual he displayed&#8211;ahem&#8211;confidence
in my judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned towards him, her face filled with delight.
&#8220;Hezekiah Wilkins,&#8221; she whispered excitedly,
&#8220;I could hug you for those words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting a good many years for you to
do that, Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped her head. &#8220;It&#8217;s the moon, Hezekiah,&#8221;
she warned him. &#8220;I forgot how to embrace any one
years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the mysterious light, it seemed to him that a
smile played about her mouth. His arm slipped about
her waist. He tipped her chin gently and looked down
into the face which for so long had meant to him the
one woman. &#8220;Is it true, Mary? You&#8217;ll marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>A stray cloud passed in front of the moon, and when
it passed, the beams lighted the porch of Aunt Kate&#8217;s
house at Old Rock.</p>

<p>The door opened and Obadiah came out, while his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span>
sister drew a shawl closer to her shoulders and waited
in the doorway. &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful night,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;a perfect Fall night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s chilly&#8211;it&#8217;s really cold,&#8221; he objected, shrugging
his shoulders. He walked to the end of the
porch and looked towards the apple tree where the
hammock swung in lonesomeness. &#8220;Where is Virginia?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She went walking with Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll freeze,&#8221; he worried.</p>

<p>Humor glinted in Aunt Kate&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Girls take
moonlight walks on the coldest winter nights and I
never heard of one freezing, Obadiah. Your blood
is thin. Come in and I&#8217;ll build a fire of chips for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; protested Obadiah, &#8220;I&#8217;ll build one for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moonbeams bathed the meadow and the pond
in their soft light. They silvered the great bowlder
left by some glacier upon the edge of this inland water.
On a depression in its side sat Joe, and Virginia was
at his side. Before them stretched the shadowed mirror
of the pond. Opposite loomed the tree clad hill
in misty gloom. The moon clothed its summit in a
mantle of light, reflected the tree-broken sky line in
delicate tracery upon the water below, and pushed a
shining pathway to their feet.</p>

<p>The spell of the night held the girl. It seemed
wrong to speak aloud. &#8220;Listen, Joe,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;the world is asleep.&#8221; From the hill came the sound
of a cow bell sweetened by distance. Except for this
and the crickets all was still. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a bit lonely,&#8221;
she sighed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>&#8220;No, not nearly as lonely as South Ridgefield after
you left,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you miss me?&#8221; She was watching the pond.</p>

<p>He stole a glance at the curves of her face and the
flash of her eyes. It seemed to him that never since
the beginning of time could there have been such another.
He had lured a spirit of the night to a seat beside
him. &#8220;I nearly died of loneliness,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor boy.&#8221; Her voice was rich in tenderness.
&#8220;Loneliness is dreadful, Joe. I don&#8217;t want you to
feel that way.&#8221; Surely this was a nymph who had
stolen forth to give him sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was miserable every moment after you left,&#8221;
he told her pathetically.</p>

<p>She turned her face to him, wonderful in its mysterious
moonlight beauty. &#8220;Joe,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;you
must not be sad. Knowing me must not bring unhappiness
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must never leave me again, Virginia. When
I am away from you I can&#8217;t be happy.&#8221; Now the blue
eyes were drawing a marvelous power of enchantment
from the moonbeams, and the black eyes were reflecting
the wonder of it. Under the charm of it, he
dropped his cane.</p>

<p>With a little cry of tenderness she tried to catch it.
Losing her balance she fell towards him. He caught
her in his arms, and the only other cloud in all the
heavens that night drifted before the moon and the
world darkened. Yet, on this old rock, lips touched
and love blazed and hearts whispered words of gladness.</p>

<p>The cloud passed on and the beams fell upon Serena,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>
who had come forth upon the stoop of the Dale kitchen
for a breath of fresh air. She raised her eyes to the
great orb hanging high above her. Its light displayed
a look of great happiness and contentment upon her
black face as she whispered into the night, &#8220;Praise be!
Ma honey chil&#8217; is er comin&#8217; home. De ole man done
conquah de evil spi&#8217;it which to&#8217;ment &#8217;im. Dat fool

<p class='c fs12'>THE TRIUMPH OF VIRGINIA DALE<br /><span class='fss'>Another GLAD Book (Trade Mark)</span></p>
<p class='c'><i>By John Francis, Jr.</i></p>
<p class='c'><i>Cloth decorative, 12mo, illustrated, $1.90</i></p>

<p>This new novel, marking the advent of a hitherto
unknown writer of fiction, offers, along with a delightful
romance of youth, a tinge of scintillating humor
that stamps itself indelibly on the mind of the reader,
and evokes many a sympathetic chuckle. It fairly
bubbles over with exuberant cheerfulness, and is sure
to inject a good share of its unlimited store of &#8220;What&#8217;s
good for the world&#8221; into every one who is lucky enough
to read it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the peculiar magnetism of the characters
is such that the reader cannot believe they are
merely book creatures, <i>and</i>, we wager they are not.
Virginia Dale, the heroine, is a Good Samaritan, Miss
Sunshine, and Glad Heart&#8211;all of these&#8211;and yet the
most natural young person imaginable, and as she progresses
in her mission of &#8220;brightening up the corner&#8221;
she builds for her own future one of the most beautiful
characters fiction has ever claimed.</p>

<p>The story is essentially a &#8220;character&#8221; story, but
this does not detract from the plot what it just seems to
get in the natural course of things, for, as a venerable
reader once aptly remarked: &#8220;When story folk act
natural, we ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to forgit &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p class='c'>THE PRINCESS NAIDA<br /><i>By Brewer Corcoran</i><br /><i>Author of &#8220;The Road to Le Rêve&#8221; etc.</i></p>
<p class='c'><i>Cloth decorative, 12mo, illustrated by H. Weston Taylor, $1.90</i></p>

<p>Adventure and romance are the keynotes of this new
novel by Brewer Corcoran&#8211;adventure which will
stir the blood of every lover of fast-moving action and
culminative plot, and romance which will charm all
who have a tender spot for a lovably beautiful girl and
a regular &#8220;he&#8221; man. It is a tale of today, set amid
the mountains of Switzerland and the ugly rocks of
Bolshevism on which is wrecked the mythical principality
of Nirgendsberg&#8211;a story of a brave little
princess who puts unfaltering faith in American manhood
and resourcefulness and finds a newer and a better
throne. Bill Hale is the sort of hero who would win any
girl&#8217;s love&#8211;a clever, capable chap with two fists and
a keen sense of humor. Whether he is matching wits
with suave Count Otto, romping with tiny Janos, fighting
for his life in the hunting lodge at Wolkensberg or
pleading for the love of his &#8220;princess who is all girl,&#8221;
he is a man. The story of his fight for all that counts
in life is told with a rush and sweep of action which
will hold the reader breathless. The dialogue, like that
in Mr. Corcoran&#8217;s other books, sparkles with humor,
but there is a certain pleasurable grimness in his method
of handling the Bolshevik which will strike an answering
note in every true American heart today.</p>

<p>&#8220;A romance of vivid interest, a love story full of
youth and adventures that thrill. The dialogue is
unusually clever, the characters delightfully real, the
plot one that holds the reader&#8217;s interest to the end.&#8221;

<p class='c'>A FLOWER OF MONTEREY<br /><span class='fss'>A Romance of the Californias</span></p>
<p class='c'><i>By Katherine B. Hamill</i></p>
<p class='c'><i>Cloth decorative, 12mo, illustrated, $1.90</i></p>

<p>The wealth, beauty and sunshine of the Californias in
the days when Spain controlled our western coast and
England looked with covetous eyes, form the setting
for this beautiful and artistic romance by a new author.
Mrs. Hamill has recreated vividly the little Spanish
town where the mission bells rang silvery at dawn, where
scarlet uniforms flashed in the stately drill of an afternoon
dress parade and beautiful women wore lace
mantillas. Pajarita, the &#8220;Flower of Monterey,&#8221; is an
American waif, cast up by the sea, who grows up among
the senors and senoritas, happy as the sunshine, but
with a healthy American disrespect for the Spanish
modes of life. Two men love her&#8211;Don Jose, the
<i>gobernador proprietaro</i> of all the Californias, and a
young American sailor-adventurer, John Asterly.</p>

<p>John Asterly, the hero of A FLOWER OF MONTEREY,
came to the Californias from Boston. He is
perhaps thirty years old, adventurous and impetuous.
At a dance on the beach at Monterey, shortly after his
arrival in the Californias, he meets Pajarita, &#8220;the
Flower of Monterey,&#8221; and falls in love with the girl,
although she is promised to her benefactor, the Spanish
Governor. On the very night before her wedding,
Asterly tries to dissuade Pajarita from her marriage
with some one other than an American, and then the
romance, rivalry and adventure begin. The historical
setting of the story is correct and the romance unfolds
with dash and symmetry.</p>

<p class='c'><i>Margaret R. Piper</i></p>

<p class='c'><i>Cloth decorative, 12mo, illustrated, $1.90</i></p>

<p>In this &#8220;story of youth for grown-ups,&#8221; the vigorous,
happy Holiday youngsters who lived in the &#8220;House on
the Hill&#8221; develop into keen, lovable young people,
thoroughly worth knowing. To Tony, as brilliant and
beautiful as a girl can well be and still be human, comes
a successful theatrical career on Broadway, and a great
love, and Larry grows into the industrious, reliant
young doctor that one would expect him to be.</p>

<p>Few writers today display the ability which Miss
Piper does to &#8220;grow up&#8221; a large family of boys and
girls, each with an individuality well developed and
attractive, and her Holiday family holds a distinctive
place in American fiction for young people today.</p>

<p>As the charming characters work their way out of
problems which face all young people of buoyant spirits
and ambitions, WILD WINGS gives a definite message
as to the happiest relationship between old and young.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a world of human nature and neighborhood
contentment in Margaret R. Piper&#8217;s books of good
cheer. Her tales are well proportioned and subtly
strong in their literary aspects and quality.&#8221; <i>North

<p class='c'>WORKS OF<br /><span class='fsl'>GABRIELE D&#8217;ANNUNZIO</span></p>

<p>Signor d&#8217;Annunzio is known throughout the world as a poet
and a dramatist, but above all as a novelist, for it is in his
novels that he is at his best. In poetic thought and graceful
expression he has few equals among the writers of the day.</p>

<p>He is engaged on a most ambitious work&#8211;nothing less than
the writing of nine novels which cover the whole field of human
sentiment. This work he has divided into three trilogies, and
five of the nine books have been published. It is to be regretted
that other labors have interrupted the completion of
the series.</p>

<p>&#8220;This book is realistic. Some say that it is brutally so.
But the realism is that of Flaubert, and not of Zola. There
is no plain speaking for the sake of plain speaking. Every
detail is justified in the fact that it illuminates either the
motives or the actions of the man and woman who here stand
revealed. It is deadly true. The author holds the mirror up
to nature, and the reader, as he sees his own experiences duplicated
in passage after passage, has something of the same
sensation as all of us know on the first reading of George
Meredith&#8217;s &#8216;Egoist.&#8217; Reading these pages is like being out in
the country on a dark night in a storm. Suddenly a flash of
lightning comes and every detail of your surroundings is
revealed.&#8221;&#8211;<i>Review of &#8220;The Triumph of Death&#8221; in the New
